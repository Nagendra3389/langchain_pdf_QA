To succeed in the mission , governments \\nmust unshackle the industry and academic institutions to play their respective roles in that \\nmammoth task.  \\n \\nTHE REAL CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\n \\nThe Survey also espoused a greater role for the corporate sector by nurturing and sustaining  a \\nculture of investing for the long term. Second, just as corporate profits are booming, the net \\ninterest margin of Indian banks has risen to a multi -year high. It is a good thing. Profitable banks \\nlend more.  \\n \\nTo sustain the good times, the Survey noted that it is important not to forget the lessons of the \\nlast financial cycle downturn. The banking industry must aim to lengthen the gap between two \\nNPA cycles. The Survey further notes that corporates benefit from the higher demand generated \\nby employment a nd income growth. The financial sector benefits from channelling household \\nsavings for investment purposes. The Survey states that these linkages must grow stronger and \\nlast longer to meet the infrastructure and energy transition investments in the coming decades.  \\n \\nThe Survey also talks about India’s working -age population to be gainfully employed, for which \\nthey need skills and good health. The Survey stated that social media, screen time, sedentary \\nhabits, and unhealthy food are a lethal mix that can und ermine public health and productivity and \\ndiminish India’s economic potential.  \\n \\nThe Survey argues for India’s traditional lifestyle, food and recipes that have shown how to live \\nhealthily and in harmony with nature and the environment for centuries.

In this  context, the National Mission on Edible Oils Oil Palm aims to \\nincrease domestic crude palm oil production to reduce the import burden. In the case of sugar, \\nthe Government announced restrictions on export in June 2022 to ensure sufficient local supplies \\nand thereby manage sugar inflation.

The Indian economy recovered swiftly from the pandemic, with its real GDP in FY2 4 being 20 per cent higher than the pre -COVID, FY20 levels. This was stated by the Economic Survey 2023 -24 presented in Parliament today by the Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt Nirmala Sitharaman. The Survey points out that the d omest ic growth drivers have supported economic growth in FY24 despite uncertain global economic performance. It also adds that during the decade endingFY20, India grew at an average annual rate of 6.6 per cent, more or less reflecting the long -run growth prosp ects of the economy. The Survey, however cautions that any escalation of geopolitical conflicts in 2024 may lead to supply dislocations, higher commodity prices, reviving inflationary pressures and stalling monetary policy easing with potential repercuss ions for capital flows. This can also influence RBIs monetary policy stance. The global trade outlook for 2024 remains positive, with merchandise trade expected to pick up after registering a contraction in volumes in 2023. The Survey highlights that leveraging the initiatives taken by the government and capturing the untappe d potential in emerging markets exports of business, consultancy and IT -enabled services can expand. Despite the core inflation rate being around 3 per cent, the RBI, with one eye on the withdrawal of accommodation and another on the US Fed, has kept interest rates unchanged for quite some time, and the anticipated easing has been delayed. The Economic Survey says that Indias economy showed resilience to a gamut of global and extern al challenges as real GDP grew by 8.2 percent in FY 24, exceeding 8 percent mark in three out of four quarters of FY 24, driven by stable consumption demand and steadily improving investment demand.The Survey underlines that the shares of the agricultu re, industry and services sector s in overall GV A at current prices were 17.7 per cent, 27.6 per cent and 54.7 per cent respectively in FY24. GV A in the agriculture sector continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace , as the e rratic weather patterns during th e year and an uneven spatial distribution of the monsoon in 2023 impacted overall output . Within the industrial sector, manufacturing GV A shrugged off a disappointing FY23 and grew by 9.9 per cent in FY24, as manufacturing activities benefitted from reduc ed input prices while catering to stable domestic demand. Similarly, construction activities displayed increased momentum and registered a growth of 9.9 per cent in FY24 due to the infrastructure build out and buoyant commercial and residential real estate demand. Various high -frequency indicators reflect the growth in the services sector. Both Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections and the issuance of e -way bills, reflecting wholesale and retail trade, demonstrated double -digit growth in FY24. Financial and professional services have been a major driver of growth post the pandemic, the survey added. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) continues to emerge as an important driver of growth. GFCF by private non -financial corporations increased by 19.8 per cent in FY23. There are early signs that the momentum in private capital formation has been sustained in FY24. As per data provided by Axis Bank Research, private investment across a consistent set of over 3,200 listed and unlisted non -financial firms has grown by 19.8 per cent in FY24. Apart from private corporations, households have also been at the forefront of the capital formation process. In 2023, residential real estate sales in India were at their highest since 2013, witnessing a 33 per cent YoY gro wth, with a total sale of 4.1 lakh units in the top eight cities. With cleaner balance sheets and adequate capital buffers, the banking and financial sector is well-positioned to cater to the growing financing needs of investment demand. Credit disbursal by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) to industrial micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and services continues to grow in double digits despite a higher base. Similarly, personal loans for housing have surged, corresponding to the increase in housin g demand. The Survey states that despite global supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions, domestic inflationary pressures moderated in FY24. After averaging 6.7 per cent in FY23, retail inflation declined to 5.4 per cent in FY24. This has b een due to the combination of measures undertaken by the Government and the RBI. The Union Government undertook prompt measures such as open market sales, retailing in specified outlets, timely imports, reduced the prices of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) c ylinders and implemented a cut in petrol and diesel prices. The RBI raised policy rates by a cumulative 250 bps between May 2022 and February 2023.The Survey says, against the global trend of widening fiscal deficit and increasing debt burden, India ha s remained on the course of fiscal consolidation. The fiscal deficit of the Union Government has been brought down from 6.4 per cent of GDP in FY23 to 5.6 per cent of GDP in FY24, according to provisional actuals (PA) data released by the Office of Control ler General of Accounts (CGA). The growth in gross tax revenue (GTR) was estimated to be 13.4 per cent in FY24, translating into tax revenue buoyancy of 1.4. The growth was led by a 15.8 per cent growth in direct taxes and a 10.6 per cent increase in indi rect taxes over FY23. The Survey adds that broadly, 55 per cent of GTR accrued from direct taxes and the remaining 45 per cent from indirect taxes. The increase in indirect taxes in FY24 was mainly driven by a 12.7 per cent growth in GST collection. The in crease in GST collection and E -way bill generation reflects increased compliance over time.The capital expenditure for FY24 stood at 9.5 lakh crore, an increase of 28.2 per cent on a YoY basis, and was 2.8 times the level of FY20. The Governments thrust on capex has been a critical driver of economic growth amidst an uncertain and challenging global environment. Spending in sectors such as road transport and highways, railways, defence services, and telecommunications delivers higher and longer impetuses to growth by addressing logistical bottlenecks and expanding productive capacities. The Sur vey says, it is also incumbent upon the private sector to take forward the momentum in capital formation on its own and in partnership with the Government. Their share in addition to the capital stock in terms of machinery and equipment, started growing ro bustly only since FY22, a trend that needs to be sustained on the strength of their improving bottom -line and balance sheets in order to generate high -quality jobs. The Survey points out that the State governments continued to improve their finances in FY2 4. Preliminary unaudited estimates of finances for a set of 23 states, published by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, suggest that the gross fiscal deficit of these 23 s tates was 8.6 per cent lower than the budgeted figure of 9.1 lakh crore. This implies that fiscal deficit as a per cent of GDP for these states came in at 2.8 per cent as against a budgeted 3.1 per cent. The quality of spending by state governments improv ed, too, with state governments focusing on Capex as well.The Union Governments transfers to the states are highly progressive, with states with lower Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) per capita receiving higher transfers relative to their GSDP. The Survey highlights that the RBIs vigil over the banking and financial system and its prompt regulatory actions ensure that the system can withstand any macroeconomic or systemic shock. Data from the RBIs Financial Stability Report of June 2024 show that the asset quality of Scheduled commercials banks has improved, with the Gross Non -Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio declining to 2.8 per cent in March 2024, a 12 -year low. The profitability of SCBs remained steady, with the return on equity and return on ass ets ratios at 13.8 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively, as of March 2024. Macro stress tests also reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios. The soundness of the banking system will fa cilitate the financing of productive opportunities and lengthen the financial cycle, both of which are necessary to sustain economic growth. The Survey highlights that o n the external front, moderation in merchandise exports continued during FY24, mainly o n account of weaker global demand and persistent geopolitical tensions. Despite that Indias service exports have remained robust, reaching a new high of USD 341.1 billion in FY24. The e xports (merchandise and services) in FY24 grew by 0.15 per cent, while the total imports declined by 4.9 per cent stated the survey. Net private transfers, mostly comprising remittances from abroad, grew to USD 106.6 billion in FY24. As a result, the C urrent Account Deficit (CAD) stood at 0.7 per cent of the GDP during the year, an improvement from the deficit of 2.0 per cent of GDP in FY23. The n et FPI inflows stood at USD 44.1 billion during FY24 against net outflows in the preceding two years. Overall, Indias external sector is being deftly managed with comfortable fo reign exchange reserves and a stable exchange rate. Forex reserves as of the end of March 2024 were sufficient to cover 11 months of projected imports.The Survey underscores that t he Indian Rupee has also been one of the least volatile currencies among its emerging market peers in FY24. Indias external debt vulnerability indicators also continued to be benign. External debt as a ratio to GDP stood at a low level of 18.7 per cent as of end-March 2024. The ratio of foreign exchange reserves to total de bt stood at 97.4 per cent as of March 2024 as per the Economic Survey 2023 - 24. The Survey points out that Indias social welfare approach has undergone a shift from an input - based approach to outcome -based empowerment. Government initiatives like providi ng free -of- cost gas connections under PM Ujjwala Yojana, building toilets under the Swacch Bharat Mission, opening bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana, building pucca houses under PM - AWAS Yojana have improved capabilities and enhanced opportunities for the underprivileged sections. The approach also involves the targeted implementation of reforms for last -mile service delivery to truly realise the m axim of no person left behind, the Survey added. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme and Jan Dhan Yoj ana-Aadhaar -Mobile trinity have been boosters of fiscal efficiency and minimization of leakages, with 36.9 lakh crore having been transferred via DBT since its inception in 2013. The S urvey says, the all -India annual unemployment rate (persons aged 15 years and above, as per usual status) has been declining since the pandemic and this has been accompanied by a rise in the labour force participation rate and worker -to-population ratio. From the genderperspective, the female labour force participation rate has been rising for six years, i.e., from 23.3 per cent in 2017 -18 to 37 per cent in 2022 -23, driven mainly by the rising participation of rural women. On the global economic scenario the Survey says that after a year marked by global uncertainties and volatilities, the economy achieved greater stability in 2023. While uncertainty st emming from adverse geopolitical developments remained elevated, global economic growth was surprisingly robust. The Survey states as per the World Economic Outlook (WEO), April 2024 of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) , the global economy registered a growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023 .

Nirmala Sitharaman . The main highlights of the Economic Survey are as follows Chapter 1 State of the Economy Steady as She Goes Economic Survey conservatively projects a real GDP growth of 6.5 7 per cent, with risks evenly balanced, c ognizant of the fact that the market expectations are on the higher side. Indias economy carried forward the momentum it built in FY23 into FY24 despite a gamut of external challenges. The focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability ensured that externa l challenges had minimal impact on Indias economy. Indias real GDP grew by 8.2 per cent in FY24, exceeding 8 per cent mark in three out of four quarters of FY24. On supply side, Gross value added (GV A) grew by 7.2 per cent in FY24 (at 2011 -12 prices) and net taxes at constant prices grew by 19.1 per cent in FY24. With deft management of administrative and monetary policies, retail inflation reduce d from 6.7 per cent in FY23 to 5.4 per cent in FY24. Current Account Deficit ( CAD) stood at 0.7 per cent of the GDP during FY24, an improvement from the deficit of 2.0 per cent of GDP in FY23. Indian economy has recovered and expanded in an orderly fashion post pandemic. The real GDP in FY24 was 20 per cent higher than its level in FY20, a feat that only a very few major economies achieved. 55% of tax collected accrued from direct taxes and remaining 45% from indirect taxes. Government has been able to ensure free food grains to 81.4 Crore people. Total expenditure allotted to capital spending have progressiv ely enhanced. Chapter 2 Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation - Stability is the WatchwordIndias banking and financial sectors have displayed a stellar performance in FY24. RBI maintained a steady policy rate throughout the year with overall inflation rate under control. Monetary Policy committee (MPC) maintained the status quo on the policy repo rate at 6.5 per cent in FY24. Inflation made to gradually align with its target while supporting growth. Credit disbursal by Scheduled Commercial Ban ks (SCBs) stood at 164.3 lakh crore, growing by 20.2 per cent at the end of March 2024. Growth in broad money (M 3), excluding the impact of merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank, was 11.2 per cent (YoY) as on 22 March 2024, compared to 9 per cent a year ago. Double-digit and broad -based growth in bank credit, gross and net non -performing assets at multi -year lows, and improvement in bank asset quality highlight the governments commitment to a healthy and stable banking sector. Credit growth remains robust mainl y driven by the lending to services and personal loans. Agriculture and allied activities witnessed double digits growth in credit during FY24. Industrial credit growth was 8.5 per cent compared to 5.2 per cent a year ago. IBC has been recognised as an e ffective solution for the twin balance sheet problem, in the last 8 years, 31,394 corporate debtors involving a value of Rs 13.9 Lakh Crore have been disposed off as of March 2024. Primary capital markets facilitated capital formation of 10.9 lakh crore d uring FY24 (approximately 29 per cent of the gross fixed capital formation of private and public corporates during FY23). The market capitalisation of the Indian stock market has seen a remarkable surge, with the market capitalisation to GDP ratio being th e fifth largest in the world. Financial inclusion is not just a goal but also an enabler for sustainable economic growth, reduction of inequality and elimination of poverty. The next big challenge is Digital Financial Inclusion (DFI).Dominance of banking support to credit is steadily being reduced and the role of capital markets is rising. As Indias financial sector undergoes critical transformation, it must brace for likely vulnerabilities. India poised to emerge as one of the fastest -growing insurance markets in the coming decade. Indian microfinance sector emerges as the second largest in the world after China. Chapter 3 Prices and Inflation - Under Control Central Governments timely policy interventions and the Reserve Bank of Indias price stabili ty measures helped maintain retail inflation at 5.4 per cent - the lowest level since the pandemic. Central Government announced price cuts for LPG, petrol, and diesel. As a result, retail fuel inflation stayed low in FY24. In August 2023, the price of d omestic LPG cylinders was reduced by 200 per cylinder across all markets in India. Since then, LPG inflation has been in the deflationary zone. Further, Centre lowered the prices of petrol and diesel by 2 per litre. Consequently, retail inflation in petr ol and diesel used in vehicles also moved to the deflationary zone. Indias policy adeptly steered through challenges, ensuring price stability despite global uncertainties Core services inflation eased to a nine -year low in FY24 at the same time, core go ods inflation also declined to a four -year low. In FY24, core consumer durables inflation declined due to an improved supply of key input materials to industries. Agriculture sector faced challenges due to extreme weather events, depleted reservoirs, and crop damage, which impacted farm output and food prices. Food inflation stood at 6.6 per cent in FY23 and increased to 7.5 per cent in FY24. Government took appropriate administrative actions, including dynamic stock management, open market operations, su bsidised provision of essential food items and trade policy measures, which helping to mitigate food inflation.29 States and Union Territories recorded inflation below 6 per cent in FY24 . Besides, States experiencing higher overall inflation tend to have a wider rural -to-urban inflation gap, with rural inflation surpassing urban inflation. Going forward, the RBI projects inflation to fall to 4.5 per cent in FY25 and 4.1 per cent in FY26, assuming normal monsoon and no external or policy shocks. IMF forec asts inflation of 4.6 per cent in 2024 and 4.2 per cent in 2025 for India. Chapter 4 External Sector - Stability Amid Plenty Indias external sector remained strong amidst on -going geopolitical headwinds accompanied by sticky inflation. Indias rank in the World Banks Logistics Performance Index improved by six places, from 44th in 2018 to 38th in 2023, out of 139 countries. The moderation in merchandise imports and rising services exports have improved Indias current account deficit which narrowed 0.7 per cent in FY24. India is gaining market share in global exports of goods and services. Its share in global goods exports was 1.8 per cent in FY24, against an average of 1.7 per cent during FY16 - FY20. Indias services exports grew by 4.9 per cent to USD 341.1 billion in FY24, with growth largely driven by ITsoftware services and other business services. India is the top remittance recipient country globally, with remittances reaching a milestone of USD 120 billion in 2023. Indias external debt has be en sustainable over the years, with the external debt to GDP ratio standing at 18.7 per cent at the end of March 2024. Chapter 5 Medium -Term Outlook A Growth Strategy for New India Key areas of policy focus in the short to medium term - job and skill cr eation, tapping the full potential of the agriculture sector, addressing MSME bottlenecks, managing Indias greentransition, deftly dealing with the Chinese conundrum, deepening the corporate bond market, tackling inequality and improving our young popula tions quality of health. Amrit Kaals growth strategy based on six key areas - boosting private investment, expansion of MSMEs, agriculture as growth engine, financing green transition, bridging education - employment gap, and building capacity of States. For Indian economy to grow at 7 per cent plus, a tripartite compact between the Union Government, State Governments and the private sector is required. Chapter 6 Climate Change and Energy Transition Dealing with Trade -Offs A report by the International F inance Corporation recognises Indias efforts to achieve committed climate actions, highlighting that it is the only G20 nation in line with 2 -degree centigrade warming. India has made significant progress on climate action in terms of an increase in its renewable energy capacity and improvement in energy efficiency. As of 31 May 2024, the share of non -fossil sources in the installed electricity generation capacity has reached 45.4 per cent. Further, the country has reduced the emission intensity of its GDP from 2005 levels by 33 per cent in 2019. Indias GDP between 2005 and 2019 has grown with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 7 per cent, whereas the emissions grew at a CAGR of about 4 per cent. The Government has launched several clean coa l initiatives, including the Coal Gasification Mission. Total annual energy savings of 51 million tonnes of oil equivalent translates to a total annual cost savings of 1,94,320 Crore and emissions reduction of around 306 million tonnes. Expanding renewable energy and clean fuels will increase demand for land and water. Government issued sovereign green bonds amounting to 16,000 Crore in January -February 2023 followed by 20,000 Crore in October -December 2023. Chapter 7 Social Sector - Benefits that EmpowerThe new welfare approach focuses on increasing the impact per rupee spent. The digitisation of healthcare, educatio n and governance has been a force multiplier for every rupee spent on a welfare programme. Between FY18 and FY24, nominal GDP has grown at a CAGR of around 9.5 per cent while the welfare expenditure has grown at a CAGR of 12.8 per cent. Gini coefficient, an indicator of inequality, has declined from 0.283 to 0.266 for the rural sector and from 0.363 to 0.314 for the urban sector of the country. More than 34.7 crore Ayushman Bharat cards have been generated, and the scheme has covered 7.37 crore hospital admissions. The challenge of ensuring mental health is intrinsically and economically valuable. 22 mental disorders are covered under the Ayushman Bharat PMJAY health insurance. Poshan Bhi Padhai Bhi programme for early childhood education aims to d evelop the worlds largest, universal, high -quality preschool network at Anganwadi Centres. Vidyanjali initiative played crucial role in enhancing educational experiences of over 1.44 cr. students facilitating community engagement and through volunteer con tributions. The rise in enrolment in higher education has been driven by underprivileged sections such as SC, ST and OBC, with a faster growth in female enrolment across sections, witnessing 31.6 per cent increase since FY15. India is making rapid prog ress in RD, with nearly one lakh patents granted in FY24, compared to less than 25,000 patent grants in FY20. Government provisioned 3.10 lakh crore in FY25 this shows a 218.8 per cent increase over FY14 (BE). Under PM -AWAS -Gramin, 2.63 crore houses were constructed for the poor in the last nine years (as of 10 July 2024). 15.14 lakh km road construction comp leted under Gram Sadak Yojana since 2014 -15 (as of 10 July 2024). Chapter 8 Employment and Skill Development Towards QualityIndian labour market indicators have improved in the last six years, with the unemployment rate declining to 3.2 per cent in 2022 -23. The quarterly urban unemployment rate for people aged 15 years and above declined to 6.7 percent in the quarter ending March 2024 from 6.8 per cent in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. According to PLFS, more than 45 per cent of the wor kforce is employed in agriculture, 11.4 per cent in manufacturing, 28.9 per cent in services, and 13.0 percent is in construction. According to PLFS, youth (age 15 -29 years) unemployment rate has declined from 17.8 per cent in 2017 -18 to 10 per cent in 20 22-23. Nearly two -thirds of the new subscribers in the EPFO payroll have been from the 18 -28 years band. From the gender perspective, the female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) has been rising for six years. As per ASI 2021 -22, employment in the organized manufacturing sector recovered to above the pre pandemic level, with the employment per factory continuing its pre - pandemic rise. During FY15 -FY22, the wages per worker in rural areas grew at 6.9 per cent CAGR vis - à-vis a corresponding 6.1 per cent CAGR in urban areas. Number of factories employing more than 100 workers saw 11.8 per cent growth over FY18 to FY22. Employment has been rising in bigger factories (employing more than 100 workers) than in smaller ones, suggesting a scaling up of ma nufacturing units. The yearly net payroll additions to the EPFO more than doubled from 61.1 lakh in FY19 to 131.5 lakh in FY24. The EPFO membership numbers grew by an impressive 8.4 per cent CAGR between FY15 and FY24. Manufacturing sector is less expo sed to AI as industrial robots are neither as nimble nor as cost -effective as human labour. The gig workforce is expected to expand to 2.35 crore by 2029 30.Indian economy needs to generate an average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs annually until 2030 in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising workforce. Compared to 50.7 crore persons in 2022, the country would need to care for 64.7 crore persons in 2050. Direct public investment equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP has the potential to generate 11 million jo bs, nearly 70 per cent of which will go to women. Chapter 9 Agriculture and Food Management Plenty of Upside Left If We Get It Right Agriculture and allied sector registered an average annual growth rate of 4.18 per cent at constant prices over the la st five years. The allied sectors of Indian agriculture are steadily emerging as robust growth centres and promising sources for improving farm incomes. As of 31 January 2024, the total credit disbursed to agriculture amounted to 22.84 lakh Crore. As of January 31, 2024, banks issued 7.5 crores Kisan Credit Card (KCC) with a limit of 9.4 lakh crores. An area of 90.0 lakh hectares has been covered under micro irrigation in the country under the Per drop more crop (PDMC) from 2015 -16 to 2023 -24. It is e stimated that for every rupee invested in agricultural research (including education), there is a payoff of 13.85. Chapter 10 Industry - Small and Medium Matters Economic growth of 8.2 per cent in FY24 was supported by an industrial growth rate of 9.5 per cent. Despite disruptions on many fronts, the manufacturing sector achieved an average annual growth rate of 5.2 per cent in the last decade with the major growth drivers being chemicals, wood products and furniture, transport equipment, pharmaceutical s, machinery, and equipment. Accelerated Coal production over the past five years has helped in reducing import dependence.Indias pharmaceutical market stands as worlds third largest by volume with the valuation of USD 50 billion. India is the worlds second -largest clothing manufacturer and one of the top five exporting nations. Indias electronics manufacturing sector accounts for an estimated 3.7 per cent of the global market share in FY22. PLI schemes attracted over 1.28 Lakh Crore of investment until May 2024, which has led to productionsales of 10.8 Lakh Crore and employment generation (direct indirect) of over 8.5 Lakh. Industry must take the lead in incentivising RD and innovation and improving the skill levels of the workforce by forgin g active collaboration with academia. Chapter 11 Services - Fuelling Growth Opportunities Services sector contribution to the overall Gross Value Added (GV A) has now reached to the level prior to pandemic i.e. about 55%. The services sector has the high est number of active companies (65 per cent). A total number of 16,91,495 active companies exist in India as of 31 March 2024. Globally, Indias services exports constituted 4.4 per cent of the worlds commercial services exports in 2022. Computer servic es and business services exports accounted for about 73 per cent of Indias services exports and witnessed a 9.6 per cent growth YoY in FY24. Indias share in digitally delivered services exports globally increased to 6.0 per cent in 2023 from 4.4 per cent in 2019. The aviation sector in India has grown substantially, with a 15 per cent YoY increase in total air passengers handled at Indian airports in FY24. Air cargo handled at Indian airports increased by 7 per cent YoY to 33.7 lakh tonnes in FY24. FY24 ended with an outstanding services sector credit of 45.9 lakh crore in March 2024, with a YoY growth of 22.9 per cent.Passenger traffic originating in Indian Railways increased by about 5.2 per cent in FY24 compared to the previous year. Revenue -earnin g freight in FY24 (excluding Konkan Railway Corporation Limited) witnessed an increase of 5.3 per cent in FY24 over the previous year. Tourism industry witnessed over 92 lakh foreign tourist arrivals in 2023, implying a YoY increase of 43.5 per cent. In 2023, residential real estate sales in India were at their highest since 2013, witnessing a 33 per cent YoY growth, with a total sale of 4.1 lakh units in the top eight cities. Global Capability Centres (GCCs) in India have grown significantly, from over 1 ,000 centres in FY15 to more than 1,580 centres by FY23 . The Indian e -commerce industry is expected to cross USD 350 billion by 2030. The overall tele -density (number of telephones per 100 population) in India increased from 75.2 per cent in March 2014 t o 85.7 per cent in March 2024. The internet density also increased to 68.2 per cent in March 2024. As of 31 March, 2024, 6,83,175 kilometers of Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) has been laid, connecting a total of 2,06,709 Gram Panchayats (GPs) by OFC in the Bhar atNet phase I II. Two significant transformations are reshaping Indias services landscape the rapid technology -driven transformation of domestic service delivery and the diversification of Indias services exports. Chapter12 Infrastructure Lifting P otential Growth Buoyant public sector investment has had a pivotal role in funding large -scale infrastructure projects in the recent years. The average pace of NH construction increased by nearly 3 times from 11.7 km per day in FY14 to around 34 km per day by FY24. Capital expenditure on Railways has increased by 77 percent in the past 5 years, with significant investments in the construction of new lines, gauge conversion and doubling. Indian Railways to introduce Vande metro trainset coaches in FY 25.In FY24, new terminal buildings at 21 airports have been operationalised which has led to an overall increase in passenger handling capacity by approximately 62 million passengers per annum. Indias rank in the International Shipments category in the World Bank Logistics Performance Index has improved to 22nd in 2023 from 44th in 2014. The clean energy sector in India saw new investment of 8.5 lakh crore (USD 102.4 billion) between 2014 and 2023. Chapter 13 Climate Change and India Why We Must Look at t he Problem Through Our Lens Current global strategies for climate change are flawed and not universally applicable. The Western approach does not seek to address the root of the problem, i.e. overconsumption, but rather chooses to substitute the means to a chieve overconsumption. A one -size-fits-all approach will not work, and developing countries need to be free to choose their own pathways. Indias ethos emphasizes a harmonious relationship with nature, in contrast to the culture of over consumption in o ther parts of the developed world. Shift towards the traditional multi -generational households would create the pathway towards sustainable housing. Mission LiFE focuses on human -nature harmony promoting mindful consumption than over consumption that lies at the root of global climate change problem. NBVVVNKSSECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24 PRESS INFORMATION BUREAU GOVERNMENT OF INDIA PREFACE OF ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24 CALLS FOR STEERING THE COUNTRY THROUGH MULTIPLE COMPACTS AND CONSENSU S WITH GOVERNMENTS, PRIVATE SECTOR AND ACADMIA INDIAN ECONOMY IS ON A STRONG WICKET AND STABLE FOOTING, DEMONSTRATING RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF GEOPOLITICAL CHALLENGES ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24 PREFACE TAKES A STOCK OF THE PAST AND PRESENT AND SUGGESTS VARIOUS MEASURES TO STEER INDIAN ECONOMY STRONGLY TOWARDS THE FUTURE New Delhi , 22nd July 2024 The tripartite compact that India needs to become a developed nation amidst emerging unprecedented global challenges is for Centre and State Governments to trust and let go, for the private sector to reciprocate the trust with long -term thinking and fair conduct and for the public to take responsibility for their finances and their physical and mental health, this was stated by the Economic Survey 2023 -24, tabled by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament, today. The Economic Survey states that the return of the National Democratic Alliance Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi with a historic mandate for the third term signals political and policy continuity. The Survey mentions that after recovery from the COVID -19 Pandemic, the Indian economy is on a strong wicket and stable footing, demonstrating resilience in the face of geopolitical challenges. How ever, for the recovery to be sustained, there has to be heavy lifting on the domestic front because the environment has become extraordinarily difficult to reach agreements on key global issues such as trade, investment and climate. STRONG INDIAN ECONOMY The Survey notes, inter alia , that there are many encouraging signs for the Indian economy High economic growth in FY24 on growth rates of 9.7% and 7% in FY23 and FY23 respectively Headline inflation rate is largely under control, although the inflation rate of some specific food items is elevatedTrade deficit lower in FY24 than in FY23 Current acc ount deficit for FY24 around 0.7 % of GDP, with current acco unt registering surplus in Q4 FY 24 Ample foreign exchange reserves Public investment sustains capit al formation in the last several years even as the private sector shed its balance sheet blues and began investing in FY22. National income data show that non -financial private -sector capital formation, measured in current prices, expanded vigorously in F Y22 and FY23 after a decline in FY21. Investment in machinery and equipment rebounds strongly after decline in FY20 and FY21 Early corporate sector data for FY24 suggests capital formation in private sector continues to expand but at a slower rate INVE STMENT INTEREST OF EXTERNAL INVESTORS Citing RBI data, the Survey noted that although Indias Balance of Payments shows us that the investment interest of external investors, measured in terms of dollar inflows of new capital, was 45.8 billion in FY24 co mpared to 47.6 billion in FY23, but the Foreign Direct Investment in India has held up. This slight decline is in line with global trends. The Survey noted that the repatriation of investment was USD29.3 billion in FY23 and USD44.5 billion in FY24. The S urvey states that many private equity investors took advantage of buoyant equity markets in India and exited profitably. It is a sign of a healthy market environment that offers profitable exits to investors, which will bring newer investments in the years to come. The Survey notes that the current environment for foreign direct investment to grow in the coming years is not highly favourable due to Interest rates in developed countries are much higher than they were during and before Covid years Emerging economies have to compete with active industrial policies in developed economies involving considerable subsidies that encourage domestic investment. Uncertainties and interpretations related to transfer pricing, taxes, import duties and non - tax policies remain to be addressed. Geopolitical uncertainties, which are on the rise, will likely exert a bigger influence on capital flows INFLUENCE OF SHOCKS ON EMPLOYMENT On employment generation, citing the Periodic Labour Force Survey, the Survey mentions tha t a surge in agriculture employment is partly explained by reverse migration and the entry of women into the labour force in rural India. And citing Annual Survey of Industries, the Survey notes that the total number of factory jobs grew annually by 3.6% between 2013 -14 and 2021 -22, and they grew faster at 4.0% in factoriesemploying more than a hundred workers than in smaller factories (those with less than a hundred workers). In absolute numbers, the Survey states that the employment in Indian factories has grown from 1.04 crore to 1.36 crore in this period. Citing the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Enterprises for 2022 -23 in comparison with the results of the NSS 73rd round of the Key Indicators of Unincorporated Non -Agricultural Enterprises (Exclud ing Construction) in India, the Survey observes that it shows an overall employment in these enterprises fell from 11.1 crore in 2015 -16 to 10.96 crore. There was a reduction of 54 lakh workers in manufacturing but the expansion of the workforce in trade and services gained in jobs limited the overall reduction in the number of workers in unincorporated enterprises to around 16.45 lakhs between these two periods. This comparison masks a big jump in manufacturing jobs that seems to have occurred between 202 1-22 (April 2021 to March 2022) and 2022 -23 (October 2022 to September 2023), it argued. Taking stock of the two big economic shocks in quick succession the Non Performing Assets (NPA) in banking combined with high corporate indebtedness, and the COVID -19 Pandemic, the Survey observes that the global backdrop for Indias march towards Viksit Bharat in 2047 could not be more different from what it was during the rise of China between 1980 and 2015. The Survey notes that in the modern world, de -globalisa tion, geopolitics, climate change and global warming, and advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) casts a huge pall of uncertainty for India as to its impact on workers across all skill levels low, semi and high. These will create barriers and hurdles to sustained high growth rates for India in the coming years and decades. The Survey states that overcoming these challenges requires a grand alliance of union and state governments and the private sector. EMPLOYMENT GENERATION REAL BOTTOM LINE FOR PRIVATE SECTOR The Survey espoused a tripartite compact between private sector, Centre and State Governments to deliver on the higher and rising aspirations of Indians and complete the journey to Viksit Bharat by 2047 as job creation happens mainly in the private sector, and many (not all) of the issues that influence economic growth, job creation and productivity and the actions to be taken therein are in the domain of state governments. Citing the results of a sample of over 33,000 companies, the Survey states that in the three years between FY20 and FY23, the profit before taxes of the Indian corporate sector nearly quadrupled and therefore, in terms of financial performance, the action lies with the private sector. The Survey argues that it is in the enlight ened self interest of the Indian corporate sector, swimming in excess profits, to take its responsibility to create jobs seriously and find people with the right attitude and skills. COMPACT BETWEEN PRIVATE SECTOR, GOVERNMENT AND ACADMIA The Survey also explores the idea of another tripartite compact - between the Government, the private sector and academia. This compact is to reboot the mission to skill and equip Indians tocatch up with and get ahead of technological evolution. To succeed in the mission , governments must unshackle the industry and academic institutions to play their respective roles in that mammoth task. THE REAL CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY The Survey also espoused a greater role for the corporate sector by nurturing and sustaining a culture of investing for the long term. Second, just as corporate profits are booming, the net interest margin of Indian banks has risen to a multi -year high. It is a good thing. Profitable banks lend more. To sustain the good times, the Survey noted that it is important not to forget the lessons of the last financial cycle downturn. The banking industry must aim to lengthen the gap between two NPA cycles. The Survey further notes that corporates benefit from the higher demand generated by employment a nd income growth. The financial sector benefits from channelling household savings for investment purposes. The Survey states that these linkages must grow stronger and last longer to meet the infrastructure and energy transition investments in the coming decades. The Survey also talks about Indias working -age population to be gainfully employed, for which they need skills and good health. The Survey stated that social media, screen time, sedentary habits, and unhealthy food are a lethal mix that can und ermine public health and productivity and diminish Indias economic potential. The Survey argues for Indias traditional lifestyle, food and recipes that have shown how to live healthily and in harmony with nature and the environment for centuries. It mak es commercial sense for Indian businesses to learn about and embrace them, for they have a global market waiting to be led rather than tapped. The Survey also argues that policymakers elected or appointed have to rise to the challenge as well. There h as to be conversation, cooperation, collaboration, and coordination across ministries, States, and between the Union and States. Noting that this challenge is easier said than done and that it has not been done before on this scale, not in the time frame a nd not amidst a turbulent global environment, the Survey called for forging and sustaining consensus between governments, businesses and the social sectors are necessary to succeed in this endeavour. AGRICULTURE CAN BE A GROWTH ENGINE IF The Survey make s a case for serving tha agricultural sector better with some re -orientation of existing and new policies and states that it is one area ripe for and in need of such a pan -India dialogue. The Survey states that the payoff will be immense if India unties th e knots that bedevil farm sector policies. More than anything else, the Survey states, it will restore faith in the self - confidence and ability of the state to steer the nation to a better future, apart from delivering socio -economic benefits. Technologi cal advancements and geopolitics are challenging the conventional wisdom. Trade protectionism, resource -hoarding, excess capacity and dumping, onshoring production and theadvent of AI are narrowing the scope for countries to squeeze out growth from manufa cturing and services. The Survey called for a return to roots, as it were, in terms of farming practices and policymaking, can generate higher value addition from agriculture, boost farmers income, create opportunities for food processing and exports and make the farm sector both fashionable and productive for Indias urban youth. This solution can become sources of Indias strength and a model for the rest of the world - developing and developed. SUCCESSFUL ENERGY TRANSITION IS AN ORCHESTRA Other prior ities, such as energy transition and mobility, may pale compared to the complexity of getting the farm sector policies right. Still, they have one thing in common with it. In the energy transition and mobility sector, the Survey stated that they require getting many things across several ministries and states aligned and this sector requires attention in the following areas a) resource dependence on hostile nations b) technological challenges such as intermittency of power generation, ensuring grid stabilit y amidst surges and drop in generation from renewable energy sources and battery storage c) recognition of the opportunity cost of tying up land in a land -scarce country d) fiscal implications that involve both additional expenditures for subsidising renewable energy generation and for e -mobility solutions, loss of tax and freight revenue currently accruing from the sale and transportation of fossil fuels e) impairment to bank balance sheets from the so -called stranded assets and f) examination of the merits of alt ernative mobility solutions such as public transportation models and more. The Survey argued for formulating original policy and practices instead of emulating other nations, as that may be neither feasible nor desirable. UNLEASHING SMALL ENTERPRISES The Survey also argued for maximum relief to small scale enterprises from the compliance burdens they face. Laws, rules and regulations stretch their finances, abilities and bandwidth, perhaps robbing them of the will to grow. LETTING GO IS PART OF GOOD GOV ERNANCE While contemplating the challenges that lie ahead, the Survey noted that one should not be daunted because the social and economic transformation of democratic India is a remarkable success story. India has come a long way. The e conomy has grown f rom around 288 billion in FY93 to 3.6 trillion in FY23 and India has generated more growth per dollar of debt than other comparable nations.The Survey argued for the Indian state to free up its capacity and enhance its capability to focus on areas whe re it has to by letting go of its grip in areas where it does not have to. The Licensing, Inspection and Compliance requirements that all levels of the government continue to impose on businesses is an onerous burden. The Survey notes that relative to hist ory, the burden has lightened. Relative to where it ought to be, it is still a lot heavier. The burden is felt more acutely by those least equipped to bear it small and medium enterprises. The Survey cites Ishopanishad that enjoins all of us to let go of (renounce) our possessions, be free and enjoy that freedom ईश वसयमद सव यतकञच जगकय जगत तन कयकतन भञजथ गध सयतसवदधन Power is a prized possession of governments. They can let go of at least some of it and enjoy the lightn ess it creates in both the governed and the governing. NBKMNECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24 PRESS INFORMATION BUREAU GOVERNMENT OF INDIA SUSTAINING AND ACCELERATING INDIAS PROGRESS IN THE FACE OF EVOLVING CHALLENGES REQUIRES DEDICATED INVESTMEN T IN STATE MACHINERY TO REINVENT AND REINVIGORATE ITSELF - ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24 SURVEY NOTES THE BEGINNING OF LATERAL ENTRY INTO THE SENIOR RANKS OF CENTRAL MINISTRIES AND RECOMMENDS FOR ITS EXPANSION ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS AND PRACTICES WILL BECOM E NECESSARY TO ENSURE POLICY OUTCOMES AT SCALE AND SPEED - SURVEY New Delhi, 22nd July, 2024 Enhancing state capacity and capability is critical to ensure that the growth strategy for Indian economy in medium term outlook achieves fruition. This was state d by Economic Survey 2023 - 24, tabled by Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. Sustaining and accelerating Indias progress in the face of evolving challenges requires dedicated investment in state ma chinery to r einvent and reinvigorate itself, says the Survey. It says that since 2014, India has made significant strides in delivering crucial infrastructure and implementing direct benefit schemes aimed at enhancing citizens well -being and the civil ser vice has been at the heart of these transformative efforts. The Survey notes that the governm ent has responded to the challenge of building state capacity by launching Mission Karmayogi, which deconstructs the problem into more tractable sub - components . It says the program builds a much -needed bridge between capacity building and human resource management systems by connecting workplace roles and workers competencies. The Survey says that capacity -building programmes, both in terms of pre -service tr aining and ongoing professional development, can be designed to build the specific competencies that a civil servant needs to perform their role well. It says the iGOT Karmayogi platform is rapidly shaping into a central node that enables civil servants to access tailored and needbased capacity - building modules, track their competency requirements and gaps, and share knowledge and learnings across departments. The Survey adds that in recent years, the Government has made a significant beginning in lateral entry into the senior ranks of Central Ministries through a transparent process and recommendsthat this needs to be substantially expanded. It says foundational and mid -career training for civil servants in all specialities has to be re -imagined for the r echarging and rebooting of skills, aptitude and attitudes. Length of tenure too is critical to grow into the demands of, and be productive and purposeful, in senior roles. Accountability mechanisms and practices will become necessary, if not already, to ensure policy outcomes at scale and speed. Annual conversations on goals and measurement at the be ginning and the end of the year at senior levels will usher in pro fessionalism and accountability , the Survey mentions. NBSKVMPRESS INFORMATION BUREAU GOVERNMENT OF INDIA INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION IN INDIA WITNESSES SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN RECENT YEARS ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24 STRATEGIC PLANNING AND STEP -UP IN PUBLIC INVESTMENT RESULT IN UPGRADATION OF ROAD NETWORK SYSTEM INTO RESILIENT AND EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AVERAGE PACE OF NH CONSTRUCTION INCREASES FROM 11.7 KM PER DAY IN FY14 TO 34 KM PER DAY IN FY24 CAPI TAL EXPENDITURE ON RAILWAYS INCREASES BY 77 PER CENT OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS RAILWAYS ACHIEVES ITS HIGHEST -EVER PR ODUCTION FOR BOTH LOCOMOTIVES AND WAGONS IN FY24 New Delhi, 22nd July 2024 With increased public investment over the last five years, India has witnessed significant expansion in physical and digital connectivity and social infrastructure including sanitat ion and water supply helping to improve quality of life of the people , states the Economic Survey 2023 - 24 tabled by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. The Surv ey notes that t he foremost among the re sponses initiated by the Union Government to overcome the pandemic -driven slowdown in the economy was increase in capital expenditure, aimed particularly at the creation of high quality physical and social infrastructure facilities. Keeping the momentum go ing over the last five years, the Survey says , capital expenditure of the Government has seen an almost three -fold increase in FY24, relative to FY20 levels. It added that the major beneficiaries of this step -up are key foundational assets like roads and r ailways. ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE The Economic Survey observes that strategic planning and step -up in public investment have resulted in the upgradation of the road network system into a resilient and efficient infrastruc ture. The capital investment by th e Government and private sector rose from 0.4 per cent in FY15 to about 1.0 per cent of GDP (around 3.01 lakh crore) in FY24. The sector has attracted its highest -ever private investment in FY24 as the private sector capitalises on a conducive policy environment, mentions the Survey. Referring to the significant pro gress in the development of national highways, the Survey says that the development of national highways, over the last ten years, has increased by 1.6 time s from 2014 to 2024. It states that the Bharatmala Pariyojana has significantly expanded the nationa l highway network, increasing the length of high -speed corridors by 12 times and 4 -lane roads by 2.6 times between 2014 and 2024. Further, the Survey notes that the efficiency of highway construction has improved due to the systematic push through the corr idor-based National Highway development approach. The average pace of NH con struction increased by 3 times f rom 11.7 km per day in FY14 to 34 km per day by FY24, it states. The survey observes that the remarkable improvement of the NH network has brought a bout substantial advancements in logistics efficiency which is evidenced by the consistently rising Indias ranking in the World Banks Logistics Performance Index, from 54 in 2014 and 44 in 2018, to 38 in 2023.To further enhance logistic efficiency, t he Economic Survey has mentioned that the Ministry of Road Transport Highways (MoRTH) has dedicated Multi -Modal Logistics Parks (MMLP). It says that a total of six multimodal logistics parks (MMLPs) have been awarded until FY24, and 2,505 crore have be en awarded for dedicated multimodal logistics parks (MMLPs) in FY24. Further, it stated, seven MMLPs are planned to be awarded in FY25. RAILWAYS INFRASTRUCTURE According to Economic Survey 2023 -24, Indian Railways, with over 68,584 route km (as of 31st March 2024) and 12.54 lakh employees (as of 1st April 2024), is the fourth largest network in the world under single management. Survey states that the capital expenditure on Railways has increased by 77 per cent over the past 5 years (2.62 lakh crore in FY24) with significant investments in the construction of new lines, gauge conversion, and doubling. The Survey notes that the Railways has achieved its highest -ever production for both locomotives and wagons in FY24. Survey st ates that 51 pairs of Vande Bharat have been introduced until March 2024. The fast pace of infrastructure augmentation has been the result of a substantial increase in financial allocation along with close project monitoring and regular follow -up with stak eholders for expeditious land acquisition and clearances, the Survey observes. The Survey has also mentioned about the initiatives undertaken by Railways for providing clean environment in and around railway stations and trains, such as replacement of con ventional toilets with bio -toilets on coaches leading to clean tracks, segregation of bio -degradablenon bio - degradable waste, solid waste management and discouraging use of single use plastic. The key focus areas for Railways, according to Economic Surve y 2023 -24 include fast capacity augmentation, modernisation of rolling stock and maintenance, improving quality of services and energy efficiency. In line with this, the Sur vey states that the investments are prioritised in areas like dedicated freight co rridors, high -speed rail, modern passenger services like Vande Bharat, Amrit Bharat Express, Aastha Special Trains, high -capacity rolling stock and last -mile rail linkages. Projects for three major corridors viz. (1) High -traffic density corridors, (2) Ene rgy, Mineral and Cement Corridors and (3) Rail Sagar (port connectivity) corridors are also planned to reduce logistics cost and carbon footprint, the Survey said. As per the Survey, Railways has also planned to reduce its carbon footprint primarily throu gh sourcing of its energy requirements through renewable energy sources and the expected requirement of installation of renewable capacity by 2029 -30 is around 30 Giga Watts. Other strategies mentioned by Survey include shifting from diesel to electric tr action, promotion of energy efficiency and afforestation.

Nirmala Sitharaman, recognizes t hat India would also not remain immune to the transformation caused by it. REQUIREMENT OF JOB CREATION UNTIL 2036 The Economic Survey 2023 -24 notes that Indian economy needs to generate an average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs annually until 203 0 in the non -farm sector to cater to the rising workforce.Annual requirement for non -farm job creation during 2024 -2036 The Survey mentions that there is a scope to supplement the existing schemes of Production Linked Incentive (PLI) (60 lakh employment generation over 5 years), MITRA Textile scheme (20 lakh employment generation), MUDRA, etc., while boosting their implementation. AI T HE BIGGEST DISRUPTOR While attributing the biggest disruption in the future of work to the accelerated growth in AI, the Economi c Survey 2023 -24 says that India, with its vast demographic dividend and a very young population, is uniquely situated as AI poses both risk and opportunity. A particular risk is the BPO sector, where GenAI is revolutionising the performance of routine cog nitive tasks through chatbots, and employment in the sector is estimated to decline considerably in the next ten years. In the following decade, however, gradual diffusion of AI is expected to augment productivity. But given the affinity of Indias popu lation to work with technology, as seen with the digital public infrastructure, proactive interventions by the Government and industry can position India as a key player in the AI age, the Economic Survey notes. MAKING THE MOST OF AI IN INDIA Highlight ing the need for research and development in this sector , the Economic Survey 2023 - 24 mentions a policy brief which suggests a need for an Inter -Agency Coordination Authority for AI which would act as a central institution guiding the research, decision -making, policy planning on AI and job creation. The Government has launched several initiatives to ensure an AI enabled ecosystem and to connect AI to the youth of the country. Some of these include Future Skills Prime, YUVAi Youth for Unnati and Vikas w ith AI a national programme for school students and ResponsibleAI for Youth 2022. A budget of 10,300 crore has been provided in 2024 for the India AI Mission, a significant move to strengthen the AI ecosystem . A SHIFT TOWARDS GIG ECONOMY According to NITI Aayogs indicative estimates based on national labour force survey data, in 2020 21, 77 lakh (7.7 million) workers were engaged in the gig economy and as per the Economic Survey 2023 -24, the gig workforce is expected to expand to 2.35 crore (23.5 million) and form 6.7 per cent per cent of the non -agricultural work force or 4.1 per cent of the total livelihood in India by 2029 30. The Survey mentions that the significant contribution in the Indian context and globally has been the creation of effective social security i nitiatives for gig and platform workers. The Code on Social Security (2020) marks a significant advancement by expanding the scope of social security benefits to encompass gig and platform workers. CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREEN ENERGY TRANSITION Recognizing the climate change as a hard reality of the pr esent times and projections pointing towards an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the Survey mentions its concomitant outcome as the possible loss of jobs and productivity. Another aspect of climate change is the efforts t o mitigate its impact by adopting green technologies and transitioning to greener energy alternatives . This trend is leading to businesses witnessing a strong job -creation effect driven by investments that facilitate the green transition of businesses and the application of ESG standards. INDIAS CORPORATE SECTOR ON RISE The Economic Survey says that Indias corporate sectors profitability is at a 15 -year high in FY24 with profits quadrupling between FY20 and FY23. It mentions that businesses have an o bligation to themselves to strike the right balance between deployment of capital and deployment of labour. In their fascination for AI and fear of erosion of competitiveness, businesses have to bear in mind their responsibility for employment generation and the consequent impact on social stability. AGRO -PROCESSING AND CARE ECONOMY FOR QUALITY EMPLOYMENT The Economic Survey 2023 -24 says that India can utilise the range of products on offer by its different agro -climatic zones and productively engag e the s izeable rural workforce, comprising women who seek remunerative part -time employment and educated youth who can be technically skilled to handle small to medium scale agro -processing units.There remains ample scope for shifting MGNREGS labour to more pro ductive and less fiscally straining ventures. Low value -addition in agriculture and rising demand for diverse and local food products also provides a good opportunity for India to create more jobs in this sector. There are also more avenues for captive dem and of agro -processed output and the secto r can benefit from the synergies between the multiple existing programmes such as Mega Food Park, Skill India, Mudra, one district -one product, etc., for labour, logistics, credit, and marketing. The care economy holds great importance for a young country like India, which has both demographic and gender dividends to reap. Highlighting the need to prepare for future care requirements of an ageing population, the Economic Survey 2023 -24 says that defining care work is the first step towards acknowledging care as work. It mentions that Indias care needs are slated to expand significantly in the next 25 years, as an ageing population follows the ongoing demographic transition while the population of children stays relatively sizeable. By 2050, the share of children is estimated to decline to 18 per cent (i.e., 30 crore persons), while the proportion of elderly persons would rise to 20.8 per cent (i.e., 34.7 crore persons). Thus, compared to 50.7 crore persons in 20 22, the country would need to care for 64.7 crore persons in 2050 . Recognising the disproportionate burden of care on women being consequential to the low Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) across the world, including India, the Survey also lays emphasis on ensuring equal opportunity for females by decoupling gender and unpaid care work. The economic value of developing a care sector is twofold increasing FLFPR and promoting a promising sector for output and job creation. The Survey mention s that in case of India, direct public investment equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP has the potential to generate 11 million jobs , nearly 70 per cent of which will go to women. Senior care reforms in India The care responsibility associated with an increas ingly older population necessitates formulating a future -ready wholesome elderly care policy with the Survey mentioning the care economy as a top-tier entry in Indias to -do list for becoming a developed nation by 2047 . According to the Asian Development B ank report, utilising this silver dividend of untapped work capacity of population aged 60 -69 years is estimated to increase GDP by an average of 1.5 per cent for Asian economies. NBSNCVMKSECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24 INDIAN LABOUR MARKET WITN ESSES IMPROVEMENT IN LAST SIX YEARS WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DECLINING TO 3.2 PER CENT IN 2022 -23 RISING YOUTH AND FEMALE WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAP THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND GENDER DIVIDEND RECOVERY WITNESSED BY ORGANIZED MANUFACTURING SECT OR ABOVE THE PRE -PANDEMIC LEVEL HIGHER WAGE GROWTH ALSO SEEN IN THE RURAL AREAS DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS EPFO NET PAYROLL ADDITIONS MORE THAN DOUBLED TO 131.5 LAKH IN PAST FIVE YEARS, SIGNALLING HEALTHY GROWTH IN FORMAL EMPLOYMENT New Delhi, 22nd July, 2024 India has witnessed improvement in the labour market indicators in last six years, as per the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data, with the unemployment rate declining to 3.2 per cent in 2022 -23. The Economic Survey 2023 -24 tabled in Parliament today by Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Niramala Sitharaman, lays emphasis on the approach of Government of India for generating suitable employment opportunities, commensurate with the legitimate aspirations of Indias youth, neces sary to reap the countrys once -in-a-lifetime demographic dividend. Current employment scenario The Economic Survey mentions that India has witnessed a notable transformation in its employment landscape, marked by several positive trends contributing to e conomic growth and social development and credits the same to various factors, including economic reforms, technological advancements, and an emphasis on skill development. According to PLFS, the all -India annual unemployment rate (UR) (persons aged 15 ye ars and above, as per usual status) has been witnessing a declining trend since the COVID -19 pandemic accompanied by a rise in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) and worker -to-population ratio (WPR). Highlighting the employment status of workers, the Survey mentions that it is the female workforce, which is shifting to self -employment, while the male workforces share has been stable as evident in the sharp rise in female LFPR in the past six years, driven by rural women joining agriculture and re lated activities.Youth and female employment Highlighting the rise in youth employment being in tandem with the youth population, the Economic Survey mentions the PLFS data of youth (age 15 -29 years) unemployment rate declining from 17.8 per cent in 2 017-18 to 10 per cent in 2022 -23. Nearly two -thirds of the new subscribers in the EPFO payroll have been from the 18 -28 years band. The Survey also highlights the rising female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) for six years and attributes the same to multiple factors, including continuous high growth in agriculture output and freeing up of womens time due to substantial expansion of access to basic amenities such as piped drinking water, clean cooking fuel, sanitation, etc. Turnaround in Factor y employment The Economic Survey says that organized manufacturing sector has recovered to above pre - pandemic level along with the higher wage growth seen in the rural areas during the last five years, which bodes well for demand creation in the countrysi de. During FY15 -FY22, the wages per worker in rural areas grew at 6.9 per cent CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) vis -à-vis a corresponding 6.1 per cent CAGR in urban areas. State -wise, the top six states in terms of the number of factories, were also t he greatest factory employment creators. More than 40 per cent of factory employment was in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. In contrast, the highest employment growth between FY18 and FY22 was seen in states with a higher share of young population, i ncluding Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The Survey also mentions the rising heft of computers and electronics, rubber and plastic products, and chemicals indicating that Indian manufacturing is moving up the value chain and have emerged as sunr ise sectors for manufacturing employment generation. EPFO Enrolment on rise The organised sector job market conditions measured by payroll data for EPFO indicate a consistent year -on-year (YoY) increase in payroll addition since FY19 (the earliest since data is available). The yearly net payroll additions to the EPFO more than doubled from 61.1 lakh in FY19 to 131.5 lakh in FY24, swiftly recovering from the pandemic aided by the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY). The EPFO membership numbers (for w hich older data is available) also grew by an impressive 8.4 per cent CAGR between FY15 and FY24. Impetus to Employment GenerationThe g overnment has implemented a series of measures to boost employment generation, such as the rollout of the Productio n Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to enhance Indias manufacturing capabilities, increase in capital expenditure, etc., and to promote worker welfare. This has been accompanied by a boost to self -employment through easing of access to credit, and multiple process reforms. The Survey mentions some of the initiatives to foster job creation and workers welfare such as launch of National Career Service (NCS) Portal, e -Shram portal, introduction of Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY) for boosting employment with social security benefits post -COVID -19 job losses, programmes such as One Nation One Ration Card and amalgamation of 29 Central Laws into four Labour Codes in 2019 and 2020. Trend in rural wages The Economic Survey 2023 -24 mentions that in FY24, ru ral wages rose at above -5 per cent every month, Y -o-Y and on an average, nominal wage rates in agriculture grew by 7.4 per cent for men and 7.7 per cent for women, benefitting from robust agriculture growth during the period. The wage growth in non -agricul tural activities was at 6.0 per cent for men and 7.4 per cent for women during the same period. Going forward, as inflation is expected to soften with the easing of international commodity prices and domestic food prices, the economic survey expects this t o translate into a sustained rise in real wages.

Nirmala Sitharaman in the P arliament today. The survey notes that the Central Bank maintained a steady policy rate throughout the year, with t he overall inflation rate under control. The effects of the monetary tightening following the Russia -Ukraine conflict are evident in the lending and deposit interest rates increase among banks. Bank loanssaw significant and widespread growth across variou s sectors, with personal loans and services leading the way. Monetary Policy The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained the status quo on the policy repo rate at 6.5 per cent in FY24. During the current tightening cycle, i.e., from May 2022 to May 20 24, the external benchmark -based lending rate and the one -year median marginal -cost-of-funds based lending rate increased by 250 bps and 175 bps, respectively. Important factors impacting the evolution of monetary and credit conditions during FY24 were the withdrawal of 2,000 banknotes (May 2023), the merger of HDFC, a non -bank , with HDFC Bank (July 2023), and the temporary imposition of the incremental CRR (I -CRR) (August 2023).The growth in Broad Money (M3), excluding the impact of the merger of HDFC w ith HDFC Bank (with effect from 1 July 2023), was 11.2 per cent (YoY) as of 22 March 2024, compared to 9 per cent a year ago. During FY24, 17 fortnightly Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) auctions and seven Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auctions were undertaken as the primary operation. In addition, 49 fine -tuning operations (25 VRRR and 24 VRR) were conducted intermittently, modulating liquidity conditions in alignment with the monetary policy stance, the survey notes. Bank Credit Credit growth remains robust, mainly driven by lending to services and personal loans. Lending by non -banking financial companies (NBFCs) accelerated, led by personal loans and loans to the industry, and their asset quality improved. Credit disbursal by SCBs stood at 164.3 lakh crore, growing by 20.2 per cent at the end of March 2024, compared to 15 per cent growth at the end of March 2023. Agricultural credit increased nearly 1.5 times from 13.3 lakh crore in FY21 to 20.7 lakh crore in FY24. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme played a pivotal role in providing timely and hassle -free credit to farmers, with over 7.4 crore operative KCC accounts at the end of 2023. Industrial credit growth picked up in H2 of FY24, registering 8.5 per cent growth in March 2024, compared to 5.2 per cent a year ago, driven by an increase in bank credit to small and large industries. Improving credit flow to the MSME sector at low cost has been a policy priority of the Government and RBI. Bank credit disbursal to the services sector remained resilient despi te a slowdown in credit growth to NBFCs Credit disbursal for housing loans increased from 19.9 lakh crore in March 2023 to 27.2 lakh crore in March 2024. Banking Sector There has been a significant enhancement in the asset quality of banks, led by improv ed borrower selection, more effective debt recovery and heightened debt awareness among large borrowers. In addition to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, qualitative metrics such as enhanced disclosures, robust code of conduct, and transparent governance structures also improved banking performance. The gross non -performing assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs continued its downward trend, reaching a 12-year low of 2.8 per cent at the end of March 2024 from its peak of 11.2 per cent in FY18. The macro -and micro -prudential measures by RBI and the Government have enhanced risk absorption capacity in recent years, improving the banking systems stability. For the top 10Indian banks in asset size, loans constitute more than 50 per cent of their total assets , making banks immune to the rising interest rate cycle. In the eight years since 2016, 31,394 corporate debtors involving a value of 13.9 lakh crore have been disposed of (including pre -admission case disposals) as of March 2024. 10.2 lakh crore of underlying defaults were addressed at the pre -admission stage . The Government has taken several measures to improve the insolvency ecosystem. It has strengthened the NCLT regarding infrastructure, increasing its strength by filling vacancies and proposing an integrated IT platform. The regulations have been amended to keep in line with the needs of the markets and the advances in judicial pronouncements, the survey notes. Strong Primary Markets The Survey highlights the remarkable expansion of Indian capital markets. Capital markets have shown impressive results, wi th Indias stock market capitalisation to GDP ratio ranking fifth globally. Primary markets remained robust during FY24, facilitating capital formation of 10.9 lakh crore (which approximates 29 per cent of the gross fixed capital formation of private and public corporates during FY23), compared to 9.3 lakh crore in FY23. Fund mobilisat ion through all three modes, viz., equity, debt, and hybrid, increased by 24.9 per cent, 12.1 per cent and 513.6 per cent, respectively, in FY24 compared to the previous year. The number of initial public offers (IPOs) increased by 66 per cent in FY24 from 164 in FY23 to 272 in FY24, while the amount raised grew by 24 per cent (from 54,773 crore in FY23 to 67,995 crore in FY24). The corporate debt market in India is going from strength to strength. During FY24, the value of corporate bond issuances increa sed to 8.6 lakh crore from 7.6 lakh crore during the previous financial year. The number of corporate bonds public issues in FY24 was the highest for any financial year so far, with the amount raised (19,167 crore) at a four - year high. Increasing invest or demand and the rise in the cost of borrowing from banks have made these markets more attractive for corporates for funding requirements. Robust Secondary Markets Indian stock market was among the best -performing markets, with Indias Nifty 50 index ascending by 26.8 per cent during FY24, as against ( -)8.2 per cent during FY23. The Survey says that the exemplary performance of the Indian stock market compared to the world can be primarily attributed to Indias resilience to global geo -political and econo mic shocks, its solid and stable domestic macroeconomic outlook, and the strength of the domestic investor base. The Indian capital markets have seen a surge in retail activity in the last few years. The registered investor base at NSE has nearly tripled from March 2020 to March 2024 to 9.2 crore as of 31 March 2024, potentially translating into 20 per cent of the Indian households nowchannelling their household savings into financial markets. The number of demat accounts rose from 11.45 crore in FY23 to 15.14 crore in FY24. FY24 has been a spectacular year for Mutual Funds as their Assets under Management (AuM) increased by 14 lakh crore (YoY growth of 35 per cent) to 53.4 lakh crore at the end of FY24, boosted by mark -to-market (MTM) gains and expansi on of the industry. Economic Survey notes that the significant increase in retail investors in the stock market calls for careful consideration as there is the possibility of overconfidence leading to speculation. It says that the firms operating in banki ng and capital markets must keep the interests of the consumers in mind through fair selling, disclosure, transparency, reliability, and responsiveness. Progress of financial inclusion The Survey highlights that the Government has prioritised delivering fi nancial services to the last mile. The number of adults with an account in a formal financial institution increased from 35 per cent in 2011 to 77 per cent in 2021. Not only there is a decline in the access gap between the rich and the poor but the gender divide in terms of financial inclusion has also narrowed. Survey notes a shift in focus of the financial inclusion strategy in the country, from every household to every adult, with added emphasis on direct benefit transfer (DBT) flows, promoting digi tal payments using RuPay cards, UPI123 etc. Highlighting the progress of financial inclusion so far in the country, the survey says that India is among the fastest -growing fintech markets in the World, hailing as the third -largest growing fintech economy. A key enabler of this financial inclusion drive has been the digitalisation of the financial system, which the survey terms transformative. Digital financial inclusion (DFI) is the next big target of the government. The survey says that the COVID -19 pandemic gave further momentum to Digital financial inclusion (DFI) when the most vulnerable and excluded citizens were severely affected. Some flagship schemes such as the Digital India Mission, Make -in- India, Aadhaar, e -KYC, Aadhaar -enabled Payment Syste m, UPI, Bharat QR, DigiLocker, e -sign, Account Aggregator, Open Network for Digital Commerce, etc came to the rescue. The success of UPI has been enhanced by the expansion of smartphone usage in India, with more than 116.5 crore smartphone subscribers as o f 31 March 2024. The value of transactions conducted on the UPI platform has increased multifold from 0.07 lakh crore in FY17 to 200 lakh crore in FY24. Microfinance has been playing an essential role in meeting low -income households credit needs by pro viding affordable doorstep services. Globally, the Indian microfinance sector is the second largest after China in terms of number of borrowing customers in India, which are about three times that of the next biggest market, i.e., Indonesia. Insurance sec torThe survey says that the insurance sector has seen a remarkable growth. India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest -growing insurance markets in the coming decade. Economic growth, an expanding middle class, innovation, and regulatory support have driven insurance market growth in India. Non -life premium growth moderated slightly from 9 per cent in FY22 to an estimated 7.7 per cent in as the market stabilised after the pandemic. Recently, Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB -PMJAY) achieved a milestone of generating 34.2 crore Ayushman cards across India, with 49.3 per cent of them held by females. Pension sector Talking about the developments in the pension sector, the survey states that Indias pension sector has expanded since th e introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and, more recently, the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The total number of subscribers stood at 735.6 lakh as of March 2024, registering a YoY growth of 18 per cent from 623.6 lakh as of March 2023. The total number of APY subscribers (including its earlier version, NPS Lite) increased from 501.2 lakh as of March 2023 to 588.4 lakh as of March 2024. APY subscribers account for around 80 per cent of the pension subscriber base. APY subscribers have witnessed an improvement in gender mix, with female subscriber share rising from 37.2 per cent in FY17 to 48.5 per cent in FY23. The survey also mentions the mechanisms to ensure regulatory coordination and overall financial stability, which should withstand unforesee n shocks so that there is a high degree of confidence. It recognizes the key role of Financial Sector Development Council (FSDC) to deal with a wide range of issues relating to financial stability and financial sector development.

The overall trade deficit reduced from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 b illion in FY24. This i s stated in the Economic Survey 2023 -24 tabled by the Union Mini ster for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament today.SERVICES TRADE The Economic Survey highlights that the share of Indias services exports in world services exports has risen remarkably from 0.5 per cent in 1993 t o 4.3 per cent in 2022. India is now the seventh -largest services exporting country globally rising phenomenally from its 24th position in 2001. Amongst services exports, softwareIT services and business services exports have increased. This was support ed by India emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres (GCCs). India ranks 2nd in the world in telecommunication, computer, and information services exports, 6th in personal, cultural and recreational services exports and 8th in other business service s exports. The growth in Global Capability Centres (GCCs) is reflected in the services BoP, with Other Business Services being the second -largest contributor in services exports in FY24 with a shareof 26%. In 2012, about 760 GCCs were operating out o f India and as of March 2023, India houses over 1,600 GCCs. MERCHANDISE TRADE India performed well in merchandise trade despite lowering in global demand with exports crossing USD 776 billion and imports reaching USD 898 billion in FY23. With this, merch andise trade deficit narrowed to USD 238.3 billion in FY24 compared to USD 264.9 billion in the previous year. There was a slowdown in Indias major exporting partners (especially the EU, whose real GDP grew barely by 0.6 per cent in 2023, compared to 3. 6 per cent growth in 2024), along with the lagged impact of monetary tightening carried out by many countries to control rising inflation. The Survey notes that adverse trade environment in 2023 is expected to ease somewhat this year and next, boosting go ods trade in 2024 and 2025. World merchandise trade volume is expected to grow at 2.6 per cent and 3.3 per cent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, as demand for traded goods rebounds. Indias exports of engineering goods, electronic goods and drugs pharmac euticals increased in FY24 on a YoY basis. Indias share in world electronics exports also improved. India maintained a strong foothold in the drugs and pharmaceuticals sector. Despite high domestic demand due to the relatively strong growth of Indias e conomy, merchandise imports contracted by 5.7 per cent in FY24, from USD 716 billion in FY23 to USD 675.4 billion in FY24. Imports of capital goods saw an increase, which is welcome as it indicates a heightened demand for machinery, equipment, and other du rable goods used in production processes, suggesting potential investments in industrial infrastructure or technological upgrades. A marginal uptick in the share of consumer goods in merchandise imports reflects a stable but limited increase in the importa tion of finished products for direct consumption.A targeted focus and a series of measures undertaken by the Government has shown robust growth in product -specific exports in sectors such as Defence, Toys, Footwear and Smartphones. The share of electro nics goods in merchandise exports of India rose from 2.7 per cent in FY19 to 6.7 per cent in FY24, taking India from 28th position in 2018 to 24th in 2022 in global electronics exports. MEASURES TO EXPAND EXPORTS The Government has undertaken various me asures to promote exports and reduce logistics costs involved in international trade which include setting export targets and their monitoring, provision of export credit insurance services and encouraging banks to provide affordable and adequate export cr edit to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) exporters, enabling them to explore new markets and diversify their existing products competitively. To boost efficiency and lower logistics costs, the Government launched the PM GatiShakti National Maste r Plan and the National Logistics Policy (NLP) in October 2021 and September 2022, respectively. Digital reforms, such as the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and the Logistics Data Bank, are additional measures taken towards improving logistics . Initiatives, such as railway track electrification, reduced release times by the Land Ports Authority of India (LPAI), and the launch of NLP Marine for port -related logistics were also undertaken. Since the launch of the NLP, over 614 industry players h ave registered on ULIP, 106 private companies have signed Non -Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), 142 companies have submitted 382 use cases to be hosted on ULIP and 57 applications have been made live as of September 2023. The Survey notes that India stands fo r an open, inclusive, predictable, non -discriminatory, and mutually beneficial international trade as it can provide an impetus to economic growth. India advocates for a rule -based international trading system with these attributes with WTO at its core. In this spirit, India considers Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) an instrument of trade liberalisation and a complement to the multilateral trading system under WTO. Accordingly, thecountry is engaged with all its trading partnersblocs to expand its export mar kets while ensuring better terms for essential imports to meet domestic demand in a cost competitive manner. The Economic Survey highlighted that India is moving up the global value chains (GVCs), with the share of GVC -related trade in gross trade rising to 40.3 per cent in 2022 from 35.1 per cent in 2019. The improvement in GVC participation is also reflected in increased pure backward GVC participation. The Survey added that Indias GVC participation has begun to rev up again on the back of incentives provided through schemes such as the PLI and Districts as Exports Hub (DEH) initiative, after the lull seen in the years succeeding the global financial crisis. Survey says that the evidence of Indias enhanced global supply chain participation is reflecte d in increased investment by foreign firms in electronics, apparel and toys, automobiles and components, capital goods and semiconductor manufacturing in India. CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE The Economic Survey highlighted that Indias Current Account Deficit (CAD) narrowed to USD 23.2 billion (0.7 per cent of GDP) in FY24 from USD 67 billion (2 per cent of GDP) during the previous year due to a decline in merchandise trade deficit, rising net services exports and increasing remittances. The Net services recei pts increased from USD 143.3 billion during FY23 to USD 162.8 billion in FY24, primarily on account of rising exports of software, travel and business services. The remittances by Indians employed overseas, was USD 106.6 billion in FY24, against USD 101.8 billion during the previous year. Remittances to India are forecasted to grow at 3.7 per cent to USD 124 billion in 2024 and at 4 per cent to reach USD 129 billion in 2025, emphasized the Survey.CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCE Emphasizing about the stable ca pital inflows which continue to finance the CAD, the Survey mentioned that during FY24, net capital flows stood at USD 86.3 billion against USD 58.9 billion during the previous year, primarily driven by FPI flows and net inflows of banking capital. The Su rvey emphasized that India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows in FY24 of USD 44.1 billion, supported by strong economic growth, a stable business environment, and increased investor confidence. Highlighting that India receiv ed the highest equity inflows among emerging market peers during FY24, the Survey listed financial services, automobile and auto components, healthcare, and capital goods were the significant sectors attracting equity inflows during FY24.The Survey noted that the Net FDI inflows to India declined from USD 42.0 billion during FY23 to USD 26.5 billion in FY24 as an impact of decline in global FDI flows. It further added that the gross FDI inflows moderated only by 0.6 per cent from USD 71.4 billion in FY23 to just under USD 71 billion in FY24. Highlighting that India has a well -established infrastructure to attract FDI in select sectors, i.e., Greenfield projects such as renewables, digital services such as telecommunications, software and hardware, and con sultancy services, the Economic Survey suggested that where investment intentions are high, the sectors must be made more accessible for investments. It further added that the focus must remain on improving the ease of doing business across sectors and ext end beyond sectors attractive to FDI alone by working out the details across all levels of government national, state and local - and across regulators. The Survey listed that educated labour and a skilled workforce coupled with a vibrant RD culture ar e important magnets to enhance sustained investor interest, apart from political stability, policy predictability and stability, reasonable duties and taxes, dispute resolution mechanisms and ease of repatriation. The Survey highlighted that during FY24, Indias Foreign Exchange Reserve (FER) increased by USD 68 billion, the highest increase among major foreign exchange reserves -holding countries.The Survey notes that the Rupee emerged as the least volatile currency among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies in FY24. It further stated that Rising FPI inflows kept the Indian Rupee in a manageable range of 82 to 83.5USD in FY24. The Economic Survey says that Indian residents overseas financial assets, by end of March 2024, was at U SD 1,028.3 billion were higher by USD 109.7 billion or 11.9 per cent compared to the level as of March 2023. The factors attributed were mainly due to a rise in reserve assets, currency and deposits, overseas direct investment, trade credit and advances an d loans. EXTERNAL DEBT The External debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.7 per cent at the end of March 2024 from 19.0 per cent at the end of March 2023. Survey added that comparing various debt vulnerability indicators of India with peer countries for 202 2 indicates that India is in a better position with relatively low levels of total debt as a percentage of Gross National Income (GNI) and short -term external debt as a percentage of total external debt.The Economy survey noted that Indias trade deficit is expected to decline further as the PLI scheme is expanded and India creates a globally competitive manufacturing base in several product categories. It added that the recently signed FTAs are expected to increase the global market share of the country s exports. The Survey mentioned that various international agencies and RBI expect the CAD to GDP to moderate to below one per cent for FY24, driven by growing merchandise and services exports and resilient remittances. The Survey listed the fall in deman d from major trading partners, Rise in trade cost, Commodity price volatility, Trade policy changes as some of the major challenges to Indias balance of trade. The Survey suggested that the changing composition of Indias export basket, enhancement in trade-related infrastructure, enhanced quality consciousness and product safety considerations in the private sector and stable policy environment are expected to play a significant role in driving Indias rise as a global supplier of goods and services. NBADVMSRAGPress Information Bureau Government of India GOVERNMENTS PRUDENT MONETARY TRADE POLICY SUPPORTED BY STRONG OUTPUT GROWTH REDUCES RETAIL INFLATION TO A FOUR -YEAR LOW OF 5.4% IN FY24 CORE SERVICES INFLATION FALLS TO A NINE -YEAR LOW IN FY24 RBI EXPECTS 4.5% HEADLINE INFLATION IN FY25 4.1% IN FY26 ECONOMIC SURVEY RECOMMENDS REVISING CONSUMER PRICE INDEX WITH FRESH WEIGHTS AND ITEM BASKETS ECONOMIC SURVEY ADVISES EXPANDING PULSES OIL SEEDS CULTIVATION WHILE DEVELOPING MODERN STORAGE AND PROCESSING FACILITIES TO REDUCE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES New Delhi, 22nd July, 2024 The Economic Survey 2023 -24, that was tabled in Parliament today, lays special emphasis on controlling Prices and Inflation as Low and stable inflation is key to sustaining economic growth. It states that Governments and Central Banks face the challenge of keeping inflation at a moderate level while ensuring financial stability. Achieving this delicate balance requires careful monitoring of economic indicators and taking appropriate and timely corrective actions. With the commitment of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the goal of price stability and policy actions by the Central Government, India has successfully managed to keep retail inflation at 5.4 per cent in FY24, the lowest level in 4 years, since the Covid -19 pandemic period.The Economic Survey highlights the fact that Indias retail inflation is lower than the emerging markets developing economies (EMDES) and world average in 2022 and 2023 as per I MF data. Survey states that factors such as established monetary policies, economic stability, well - developed and efficient markets that balance supply and demand conditions, and stable currencies contribute to the effective management of inflation. Histor ically, inflation in advanced economies has generally been lower than in EMDEs. Inflation Management With the goal of maintaining price stability, many countries have established their own inflation targets based on various factors that serve their eco nomic objectives best. Lauding Indias Inflation Management, the Economic Survey states that interestingly, India is performing better than various developed and emerging economies in relation to its inflation target. In 2023, Indias inflation rate was wi thin its target range of 2 to 6 per cent. Compared to advanced economies like the USA, Germany, and France, India had one of the lowest deviations from its inflation target in the triennial average inflation from 2021 -2023. Despite the challenges posed by global demand -supply imbalances due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, Indias inflation rate was 1.4 percentage points below the global average in 2023. Since 2020, countries have been facing challenges in controlling inflation. India has been able to bring about a declining trend in Headline and Core Inflation through its prudent administrative measures and monetary policy. As per the Economic Survey, since May 2022, monetary policy broadly focused on absorbing excess liquidity in the system by increasi ng the policy repo rate by 250 basis points from 4 per cent in May 2022 to 6.5 per cent in February, 2023. Thereafter, the policy rate was kept unchanged by focusing on the gradual withdrawal of accommodation, aiming to align inflation with the target, whi le simultaneously fostering growth. Consequently, the persistent and sticky core inflation observed in FY23 declined to 3.1 per cent in June, 2024 The Survey further asserts that administrative measures such as price cuts for LPG, petrol, and diesel led t o lower LPG and petroleum product inflation. LPG inflation rate has been in the deflationary zone since September 2023 while retail inflation in petrol and diesel moved to the deflationary zone in March 2024. Additionally, global commodity prices declined in 2023, reducing price pressure in energy, metals, minerals, and agricultural commodities through the imported inflation channel. Low fuel and core inflation ensured a downward trajectory for headline inflation, despite volatility in food prices in FY24. As per the recent data released by MoSPI, the retail inflation rate was 5.1 per cent in June 2024. Core inflation , measured by excluding food and energy items from CPI headline inflation has witnessed a four year low in FY24. From the pandemic -driven high s, inflationary pressures in India eased in FY22, aided by softening food inflation. Inflationary pressures firmed up in FY23 yet again driven by the Russia -Ukraine war disrupting the recouping supply chains leading to a rise in food and fuel prices. In FY 24, the price situation improved. CPI inflation moderated, driven by a decline in core inflation in both goods and services. Core services inflation eased to a nine-year low in FY24 at the same time, core goods inflation also declined to a four -year low.Trends in core inflation are important in determining the contours of monetary policy. Assessing the emerging patterns of price pressures, the RBI increased the repo rate gradually by 250 basis points since May 2022 to curtail inflationary pressures, l eading to reduction of around 4 percentage points in core inflation between April 2022 and June 2024. This was aided by moderation in housing rental inflation, with a significant increase in the stock of new houses in 2023. Consumer durables inflation increased progressively between FY20 and FY23 by more than 5 percentage points, mainly due to increase in gold prices in FY21 and clothing in FY22 and FY23. With the improvement in the supply of key raw materials, the inflation rate for consumer durables decl ined in FY24. However, record -high gold prices, driven by anticipated Fed rate cuts and escalating geopolitical uncertainty, have exerted upward pressure on overall durables inflation. Consumer non -durables (CND) inflation plunged in FY20, it started to in ch up in FY21, reached an all -time in FY22, and declined sharply in FY23 and FY24. Food Inflation has been a global phenomenon in the last two years. Research indicates the rising vulnerability of food prices to climate change. In FY23 and FY24, the agric ulture sector wasaffected by extreme weather events, lower reservoir levels, and damaged crops that adversely affected farm output and food prices. So, food inflation based on the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) increased from 3.8 per cent in FY22 to 6.6 per cent in FY23 and further to 7.5 per cent in FY24. However, the government took prompt actions, including open market sales, retailing in specified outlets, and timely imports, to ensure an adequate supply of essential food items. Additionally, to ensu re food security for the poor, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, which provides free food grains to more than 81 crore beneficiaries, was extended for a period of five years starting from January 2024. Global Food Prices and Domestic Inflation Global food prices also have an impact on domestic inflation. In India, the edible oil market is heavily depends on imports, with more than 50 per cent of the total edible oil requirement being imported, making it sensitive to global prices. The Governmen t closely monitors global market trends to ensure the availability of edible oils for consumers at an affordable price. Efforts are also made to balance imports with domestic production to mitigate the risks associated with global price volatility. In this context, the National Mission on Edible Oils Oil Palm aims to increase domestic crude palm oil production to reduce the import burden. In the case of sugar, the Government announced restrictions on export in June 2022 to ensure sufficient local supplies and thereby manage sugar inflation. These export restrictions have indeed played a role in stabilising domestic sugar prices. As a result, even though the global sugar price index inflated and has been showing volatility since February 2023, domestic sugar prices have remained much less volatile. Elaborating on the Interstate variations in Retail Inflation, the Economic Survey asserts that inflation rate was less than 6 per cent in 29 out of the 36 States and Union Territories. These Interstate variations i n inflation are more pronounced in rural areas since rural consumption basket has a much higher weightage of food items (47.3%) than the urban (29.6%). Hence, in the last two years, States that witnessed elevated food prices also experienced higher rural i nflation. Future Inflation Projections RBI and IMF have projected Indias consumer price inflation will progressively align towards the inflation target in FY26. Assuming a normal monsoon and no further external or policy shocks,the RBI expects headline inflation to be 4.5 per cent in FY25 and 4.1 per cent in FY26. IMF has projected an inflation rate of 4.6 per cent in 2024 and 4.2 per cent in 2025 for India. The World Bank expects that the global supply of commodities will increase, and so will their de mand due to improved industrial activity and trade growth. It projects a 3 per cent decline in the commodity price index in 2024 and a 4 per cent decrease in 2025, mainly driven by lower energy, food and fertiliser prices. The energy price index is expecte d to reduce due to significant declines in coal and natural gas prices this year. Fertiliser prices are likely to weaken but remain above 2015 -2019 levels due to strong demand and export restrictions. Base metal prices are projected to rise, reflecting inc reased global industrial activity and clean energy production. In general, the current downward movement in the prices of commodities imported by India is a positive for the domestic inflation outlook. The short -term inflation outlook for India is beni gn. However, from the angle of long -term price stability, the Economic Survey suggests exploring the following options as the way forward1. Reducing import dependence for edible oils by increasing domestic production of major oilseeds, Exploring potenti al of non -conventional oils such as rice bran oil and corn oil and expanding scope of National Mission on Edible Oils 2. Expand the area under pulses, particularly lentils, tur, and urad, in more districts and rice - fallow areas. Promoting the summer cult ivation of urad and moong in areas with assured irrigation facilities. 3. Further improving and developing modern storage and processing facilities for vegetables, especially tomatoes and onions. 4. Improving swiftness and effectiveness of administrative action by the Government to deal with price flare -ups in specific items by collating high -frequency price monitoring data, from the farm gate to the final consumer, in a quantifiable manner. Expediting producer price index for goods and services for bette r grasp on episodes of cost -push inflation and 5.

The country has come a long way from being a food deficit and importing country in the 1960s to being a net exporter of agricultural products, highlights The Economic Survey 2023 -24, tabled by the Union Finance and Corporate Minister Smt Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. The need of the hour is to move from basic food security to nutritional security , points out the Survey. The Survey further notes tha t, we need more pulses, millet, fruits and vegetables, milk, meat and their demand is growing faster than that of basic staples. So, farm sector policies should align more with a demand -driven food system that is more nutritious and aligned with Nature s resource endowments, suggests the Survey . The Economic Survey elaborates five policy recommendations that governments can take to ensure that the markets function in the interest of the farmer. The first step talks about not banning futures or options at the first sign of price spikes. The intelligent regulatory design of such markets can obviate the need for bureaucratic interference in the futures market for agricultural commodities, adds the Survey.The s econd recommendation by the Survey talks about invoking export bans only under exceptional circumstances and allowing domestic consumers to substitute, especially if the agricultural commodities in question are not essential consumption items such as foodgrains. Farmers should be allowed to benefit f rom higher internat ional prices, states the Survey. As the third step, the Survey talks about re -examining the inflation -targeting framework . It says that Indias inflation targeting framework should consider targeting inflation, excluding food. Higher food prices are, more often, not demand -induced but supply -induced. It is worth exploring whether Indias inflation targeting framework should target the inflation rate excluding food, notes the Survey. The Survey further notes that h ardships caused by hi gher food prices for poor and low -income consumers can be handled through direct benefit transfers or coupons for specified purchases valid for appropriate durations The fourth recommendation talks about the need for increasing the Total Net Irrigated Are a. Several states are well below the national average and Indias irrigation efficiency is only 30 -40 percent for surface water and 50 -60 per cent for groundwater , points out the Survey. The Survey highlights the need for better water utilisation farming p ractices and technol ogies like drip and fertigation. The fifth and final suggestion by the Survey is about making farming consistent with climate considerations. Grains such as rice a nd sugarcane are water -guzzling crops and c ultivation of paddy gives ris e to methane emissions. The time has come to promote crop -neutral incentive structures, says the Survey. Agricult ure is at the confluence of three of the greatest challenges of the 21st century sustaining food and nutrition security, adaptation and miti gation of climate change, and sustainable use of critical resources such as water, energy, and land , highlights the Survey. The Survey notes that although a griculture and allied sectors hold significant p otential for gainful employment, Indi a is yet to ful ly exploit the potential of agriculture to contribute to economic growth and employment generation. The agricultural sector requires a serious structural transformation due to challenges posed by water scarcity and climate change adds the Survey. The sur ge in a gricultural employment in COVID years due to reverse migration, the decline in the growth rate of value addition in agriculture in FY24, and an extremely hot summer in the Northwestern and central regions of the country in the summer of 2024 with ri sing water stress and energy consumption make a serious and honest stock -taking of Indias farm sector policies imperative, concludes the Survey.

JOINT LIABILITY GROUPS (JLGS) HA VE EMERGED AS AN ESSENTIAL SOURCE OF CREDIT FOR TENANT FARMERS New Delhi, 22nd July, 2024 Economic Survey 2023 -24 was presented in the Parliament today by Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman. The Economic Survey states that t he Gross Capital Formation (GCF ) of the agriculture sector and the share of GCF in the agriculture and allied secto rs as a percentage of Gross Value Added (GVA) has been growing steadily, mainly due to increased public investment. The GCF of the agriculture sector grew at the rate of 19.04 per cent in 2022 -23, and the GCF as a percentage of GVA rose from 17.7 per cent in 2021 -22 to 19.9 per cent in 2022 -23, suggesting an increase in investment in agriculture. The average annual growth in GCF from 2016 -17 to 2022 -23 was 9.70 percent. The Survey states that despite the increasing trend in GCF, there is a need to further b oost agriculture investment, especially in the context of doubling farmers income. The DFI 2016 report indicated that to double farmers income over the period of 2016 -17 to 2022 -23, income would need to grow at an annual rate of 10.4 per cent in the farm sector, which in turn would require an annual growth rate in agr iculture investment of 12.5 per cent.The governments priority has been to provide timely, cost -effective, and adequate credit that reduces the dependence on non -institutional credit and increases investment. The measures have reduced the share of non -institutional credit from 90 per cent in 1950 to 23.40 per cent in 2021 -22. As of 31 J anuary 2024, the total credit disbursed to agriculture amounted to 22.84 lakh Crore, with 13.67 lakh Crore allocated to crop loans (short term) and 9.17 lakh Crore to term loans.

As a further measure, the KCC was extended to meet the working capital needs of fisheries and animal h usbandry activities in 2018 -19, along with the enhancement of the limit for collateral -free loans to 1.6 lakh. In the case of a Tri -Partite Agreement (TPA) among borrowers, milk unions, banks, the collateral -free loan can go up to 3 lakh As of March 31 , 2024, 3.49 lakh KCC and 34.5 lakh KCC were issued to fisheries and animal husbandry activities, respectively. Economic Survey states that Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) have emerged as an essential source of credit for tenant farmers. JLG accounts have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43.76 per cent over the past five years, emerging as a vital source in meeting the credit needs of tenant farmers and marginalised segments. Agriculture InfrastructureEconomic Survey shows that a s of 30t h April 2024, 48357 projects were sanctioned for storage infrastructure with 4570 Crore released as subsidy, and 20878 other projects are also under progress with 2084 Crore released as subsidy.

Economic Survey calls for e nhancing private sector investment in agriculture saying it is vital to provide impetus to the agriculture sector. Investment in technology, production methods, marketing infrastructure, and reduction in post -harvest losses need to be scaled up. A greater focus on post -harvest infrastructure and the development of the food processing sector can reduce wastageloss and increase the l ength of storage, ensuring better prices for the farmers.Economic Survey says that i n 2022 -23, foodgrain production hit an all -time high of 329.7 million tonnes, and oilseeds production reached 41.4 million tonnes. In 2023 -24, food grain production i s slightly lower at 328.8 million tonnes, primarily because of poor and delayed monsoons. The domestic availability of edible oil has risen from 86.30 lakh tonnes in 2015 -16 to 121.33 lakh tonnes in 2023 -24. The total area coverage of all oilseeds has incr eased from 25.60 million hectares in 2014 -15 to 30.08 million hectares in 2023 -24(17.5 percent growth).

As per All India Survey on Higher Education ( AISHE ) 2021 -22, total enrolment in higher education has increased to nearly 4.33 crore in FY22 from 4.14 crore in FY21 and 3.42 crore in FY15 (an increase of 26.5 per cent since FY15), said the Economic Survey 2023 -24 tabled in Parliament today by the Union Finance and Corporat e Affairs Minister, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman. Rising equity in higher education The Survey mentioned that the rise in enrolment in higher education has been driven by underprivileged sections such as SC, ST and OBC, with a faster growth in female enrolmen t across sections. Female enrolment in higher education increased to 2.07 crore in FY22 from 1.5 7 crore in FY15, i.e. a 31.6 per cent increase. The growing equity in higher education implies better employment opportunities for the hitherto backward section s. Re-imagining lifelong learning through a digital prismThe Survey mentioned that India has 26.52 crore students in school, 4.33 crore in higher education and more than 11 crore learners in skilling institutions. The vast expanse of the educational lan dscape comprises 14.89 lakh schools, 1.50 lakh secondary schools, 1.42 lakh higher secondary schools, 1,168 Universities, 45,473 colleges, 12,002 standalone institutions, 94.8 lakh teachers in school education and 15.98 lakh teachers in higher education. The National Credit Framework (NCrF), announced under N ational Education Policy 2020 in April 2023, forms the bulwark of the regulatory architecture underpinning life -long learning. Bolstering the regulatory architecture is an extensive array of digital so lutions, such as digital public infrastructure (DPI), which act as force multipliers. Prime among Indias educational DPIs is APAAR, i.e. Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry, which serves as an electronic registry for institutions, students, and faculty by creating unique identities and lifelong academic credentials for each stakeholder in the education space. APAAR is supplemented by the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC), an online repository of academic credits that facilitates students mobility a cross Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through a formal process of credit recognition, accumulation, transfer and redemption. Once an APAAR ID is created, HEIs map the credits a student earns to their ID, with all such credits stored in the ABC in dema t form. The twin solution of APAAR and ABC, by allowing real -time verification of identity and academic credentials, paves the way for several interesting use cases. These include the possibility of students pursuing credit courses from different institut ions for a particular qualification (now a reality) or targeting scholarships internships educational loans using academic profiles. As of July 2024, 2037 HEIs have onboarded ABC, and 30.13 crore APAAR IDs have been created for students of higher educati on, school education and skill institutes. Way forward in education The Survey highlighted that as education is one of the most critical areas for Indias development, mission -mode and cost-effective implementation of well - designed and well -intentioned p rogrammes is essential to improve the quality of education, especially primary education, without which further years of education add little value. To realise the same, unity of purpose and convergence of efforts across the centre, state, and local Govern ments is called for, as public education is a concurrent list subject.Increasing the cost -effectiveness of public spending on education requires spending on pedagogy and governance. This can include filling supervisory positions to monitor teaching quality, recognition of good and bad teacher performance, and hiring of local volunteers to ensure teaching at the right level as textbook completion means little if children are way behind curricular standards. India making headway in RD The Survey high lighted that India is making rapid progress in RD, with nearly 1,00,000 patents granted in FY24, compared to less than 25,000 patent grants in FY20. According to WIPO, India saw the highest growth (31.6 % ) in patent filings in 2022 . India has consistentl y improved its rank in the Global Innovation Index (GII) from 81st position in 2015 to 40th in 2023, as per GII (2023). On the human resource side, total Ph.D. enrolment in India has increased to 81.2 per cent in FY22 (2.13 lakh) from FY15 (1.17 lakh). Th e Gross Expenditure on RD (GERD) in the country has been consistently increasing over the years and has more than doubled from 60,196.8 crore in FY11 to 127,381 crore in FY21 As a mark of Indias ascent in high -quality research, the country climbed up to 9th rank in the Natures Index 2023, overtaking Australia and Switzerland. Indias share of high -quality research articles (measured in terms of absolute numbers and not percentages) increased by 44 per cent in the past four years, i.e., from 1039.7 in 2019 to 1494.7 in 2023.

This foundation will act as an apex body that aims to strengthen and promote the RD ecosystem. In the interim budget of FY25, the Government also announce d a corpus of Rs. 1 lakh crore for research and innovation in the country, adopting the slogan Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhan. NB MVAKECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24 PRESS INFORMATION BUREAU GOVERNMENT OF INDIA NEW SKILLING INITIATIVES AND REVAMPING THE EXISTING ONE S SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE OF HIGH PRIORITY TO THE GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24 THE SURVEY CALLS UPON THE INDUSTRY TO TAKE LEAD IN SKILL CREATION LINKING SKILL DEVELOPMENT WITH PRODUCTION LINKED INCENTIVE SCHE ME AND EMPLOYMENT -LINKED INCENTIVE SCHEMES IN HIGH GROWTH POTENTIAL SECTORS CAN AID IN UPGRADING OF SKILLS INDIA N ECONOMY NEEDS TO GENERATE NEARLY 78.51 LAKH JOBS ANNUALLY IN THE NON -FARM SECTOR TO CATER TO THE RISING WORKFORCE New Delhi, 22nd July, 2 024 Indias education policies and skill policies should adopt a laser -like focus on learning and skilling outcomes and need to be aligned with each other, as well. This is one of the six major pillars for realizing the collective goal of ViksitBharat204 7 in the medium term, as stated in the Economic S urvey 2023 -24, tabled by Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. Terming that the NEP (New Education Policy) 2020 provides a good framework to realise t his objective, the S urvey says new skilling initiatives and revamping the existing skilling initiatives should continue to be of high priority to the Government. Skills are acquired on the foundations built by the education system, especially at the school s. Therefore, schooling should focus on the basic requirement of foundational literacy and numeracy and the realisation of grade -appropriate learning outcomes, adds the Survey. The Survey also calls upon the industry to take l ead in skill creation saying i t has much to gain from taking the initiative with academic institutions rather than leaving it only up to the governments to do the heavy lifting. Indeed, it should be the other way around, s ays the S urvey. The Economic Survey 2023 -24 states that the gove rnment is taking measures to create the job and entrepreneurial opportunities that are in sync with the aspirations and abilities of Indias youth. Highlighting the significant improvement in the proportion of skilled people across allsocio -economic class ifications, the Survey mentions that 4.4 per cent of the youth in the age cohort of 15 -29 years have received formal vocationaltechnical training, while another 16.6 per cent received training through informal sources. The Economic S urvey says that the skill development is at the centre of changes happening in education and labour markets amid the global megatrends, such as automation, action against climate change, the digitalisation of products and services, which are changing the nature of work and ski lls demands. It says that with one of the youngest populations, a median age of 28, India can harness its demographic dividend by nurturing a workforce that is equipped with employable skills and prepared for the needs of the industry. The S urvey mentions that India has not only recognised the potential of its young workforce but also the issues associated with skilling such a vast population. It says the National Policy on Skill Development Entrepreneurship (NPSDE) focuses on bridging gaps, improving ind ustry engagement, establishing a quality assurance framework, leveraging technology, and expandin g apprenticeship opportunities. This, in combination with the National Education Policy (NEP), holds tremendous potential for bridging the education -employment gap in India, adds the S urvey. The S urvey mentions that sixty -five per cent of Indias fast -growing population is under 35, and estimates show that about 51.25 per cent of the youth is deemed employable. However, it must be noted that the percentage has i mproved from around 34 per cent to 51.3 per cent in the last decade , the S urvey adds. Noting that productive jobs are vital for growth and inclusion, the survey says Indias workforce is estimated to be nearly 56.5 Crore and will continue to grow until 204 4. It estimates that the Indian economy needs to generate nearly 78.51 lakh jobs annually in the non -farm sector to cater to the rising workforce. However, to create these many jobs, there is a need to create the conditions for faster growth of productive jobs outside of agriculture, especially in organized manufacturing and services, even while improv ing productivity in agriculture, the S urvey adds. The Survey calls for maximizing the outcomes from various skilling initiatives through convergence , and utilization of synergies with other employment -centric programmes which can further mutually benefit the two verticals. Linking skill development with Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and employment -linked incentive schemes in high growth potential sec tors like toy, apparel, tourism, logistics, textiles, leather sector etc. would aid upgrading of skills as production moves up the value chain. On the apprenticeship promotion front also, there remains considerable scope to add flexibility to the regulator y framework, the Survey noted.

This was stated by Economic Survey 2023 -24, tabled by Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. Noting that the MSME sector occupies the centre stage in India s economic story, the Survey adds the sector continues to face extensive regulation and compliance requirements and faces significant bottlenecks with access to affordable and timely funding being one of the core concerns. It says Licensing, Inspection, a nd Compliance requirements that MSMEs have to deal with, imposed particularly by sub -national governments, hold them back from growing to their potential and being job creators of substance. The Survey says threshold -based concessions and exemptions create the unintended effect of incentivising enterprises to cap their sizes below the thresholds and therefore, calls that threshold -based incentives must have sunset clauses. Calling for deregulation as a vital policy contribution, the Survey says revival or creation of institutional mechanisms for dialogue with states on required policy changes is essential. It adds that much of the action has to happen at the level of sub -national (state and local) governments. MSME entrepreneurs also need training in criti cal areas of enterprise management, such as human resource management, financial management, and technology. The productivity of owner -entrepreneurs unleashed by such training will be immense, says the survey. The Survey mentions that MSMEs are the bac kbone of the Indian economy, contributing approximately 30 per cent of the countrys GDP, 45 per cent of manufacturing output, and providing employment to 11 crore of Indias population. It says the Government of India has been proactive in boosting the gr owth of the MSME sector, through initiatives such as the allocation of 5 lakh crore Emergency Cred it Line Guarantee Scheme for businesses, including MSMEs equity infusion of 50,000 crore through the MSME Self -Reliant India Fund Newrevised criteria for t he classification of MSMEs rollout of Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance programme with an outlay of 6,000 crores over 5 years Launch of Udyam Assist Platform on 11.01.2023 to bring the In formal Micro Enterprises under the formal ambit for availin g the benefit under Priority Sector Lending .

TELECOMMUNICATION SECTOR The Economic Survey notes that the usage and underlying technologies of telecommunications have undergone massive changes, especially in the past decade. It s ays that the Telecommunications Act 2023 was enacted to amend and consolidate the laws on telecommunication services and networks, assignment of spectrum and related matters. Highlighting the importance of test labs for ensuring the functionality, reliabi lity and interoperability of telecommunications devices, the Survey observes that these specialised facilities are equipped with advanced testing infrastructure to evaluate the performance of various telecommunications equipment such as routers, switches, base stations, and communication protocols. It observes that more than 69 labs have been designated as conformity ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24assessment bodies for EMIEMC, safety evaluations, technical requirements and RF testing of telecom products. The Survey further notes that the Government has introduced guidelines for the Spectrum Regulatory Sandbox (SRS), or Wireless Test Zones (WiTe Zones), as part of the Millennium SRS initiative to foster innovation, enhance ease of doing business, promote Make in India in the telecommu nications secto r. The survey states that , This initiative provides a simplified regulatory framework to facilitate Research and Development (RD) activities, promote exploration of spectrum bands and drive technological advancements. WiTe Zones have been categorised into urban or remote areas for experimentation across various frequency bands, with eligibility extending to academia, RD labs, telecom providers and others, says the Survey. ELECTRONICS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTOR The G overnment has envisioned the India AI programme as a mission -centric approach for leveraging transformative technologies to boost inclusion, innovation, and adoption for social impact, mentions the Survey 2023 -24. According to the Survey, pillars of India A I include AI in Governance, AI IP Innovation, AI Compute Systems, Data for AI, Skilling in AI, and AI Ethics Governance. As part of building AI in India and AI for India, the first edition of the IndiaAI was released in October 2023, notes the S urvey. Being the founding member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI), the Survey says that India has contributed to the GPAI goals and objectives and is working on various domestic initiatives for the responsible development, deplo yment, and adoption of AI. Further, it states that the Union Cabinet has approved an allocation of over 10,300 crore towards the comprehensive IndiaAl Mission to democratise access to Al innovation pillars and ensure global competitiveness of Indias Al e cosystem. Under the Digital India programme, initiated in July 2015 to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy, various digital initiatives have been undertaken for the delivery of citizen -centric services, the Survey men tions. BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) For complex infrastructure projects in India, the Economic Survey states, adopting B uilding Information Modelling can reduce the average project delays of 39 months, reduce infrastructure construction costs up to 30 per cent, maintenance costs up to 20 per cent, information and systemic inefficiencies up to 20 per cent, construction sector related carbon emission up to 38 per cent, water consumption up to 10 per cent and improve investments in construction RD by one per cent, and result in over four million skilled professional employment and about 2.5 million additional construction sector jobs by reinvesting savings in additional infrastructure.

It is emerging as one of the largest unified electricity grids in the world, states the Economic Survey 2 023-24 tabled by Union Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs, Smt Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. Until 31 March 2024, transmission systems have expanded t o 4,85,544 circuit kilometre of transmission lines and 12,51,080 mega volt amp (MVA) of transformation capacity , the Survey notes . Government of India has accelerated its efforts to enhance the sector and meet the continuously rising demand for electricity in the country . The peak electricity demand increased by 13 per cent to 243 GW in FY24. Between FY23 and FY24, the Survey says, the maximum rise in electricity generation was recorded in renewable energy resources for utilities. As per the Economic Survey , a total of 2.86 crore households have been electrified since the launch of the Saubhagya in October 2017 under various schem es. Further, it states that the implementation of Electricity (late payment surcharge and related matters) Rules, 2022 have given relief to the DISCOMs, as well as electricity consumers and generating companies. RENEWABLE SECTOR Under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change India has committed to achieve about 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non -fossil fuel -basedenerg y resources by 2030. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is working towards achieving 500 Giga Watt (GW) of installed electricity capacity from non -fossil sources by 2030. The Economic Survey states that , as of 31 Marc h 2024, a total of 190.57 GW of renewable energy (RE) capacity has been installed in the country . The share of RE in the total installed generation capacity in the country stands at 43.12 per cent, it notes. The clean energy sector in India saw new inves tment of 8.5 lakh crore between 2014 and 202 3, the Survey highlights. It says that t he RE sector is expected to attract investments of about 30.5 lakh crore in India between 2024 and 2030 and t his would create significant economic opportunities across the value chain. As per the National Electricity Plan of the Central Electricity Authority, the Survey mentions that the non -fossil fuel (hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, biomass, small hydro, pump storage pumps) based capacity which is around 203.4 GW (46 per cent of the total) out of 441.9 GW of total installed capacity in 2023 -24 is likely to increase to 349 GW (57.3 per cent) in 2026 -27, and 500.6 GW (64.4 per cent) in 2029 -30.

Nirmala Sitharama n. Delving further into Indias achievements on addressing climate change, the Survey quoted a recent report by the International Finance Corporation , which highlighted that India is the only G20 nation in line with 2 -degree centigrade warming. The survey further mentioned that t he hallmark of Indias growth strategy is to manage the impact of climate change and at the same time give desired focus to developmental priorities. ECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24Significant Progress Made by India on Climate Action India achieved most targets of the first NDC well in advance . Nation achieved 40 per cent cumulative electrical power installed capacity from non -fossil fuel -based energy sources in 2021 and reduced the emission intensity of Indias GDP from 2005 levels by 33 per cent in 2019 nine and eleven years before the target year of 2030, respectively. Further, a s of 31 May 2024, the share of non -fossil sources in the installed electricity generation capacity has reached 45.4 per cent up from 32 per cent in April 2014. India is also on track to make an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3.0 billion tonnes through tree and forest cover by 2030, with a carbon sink of 1.97 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent having already been created from 2005 to 2019. Indias GDP between 2005 and 2019 has grown wit h a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about seven per cent, whereas the emissions grew at a CAGR of about four per cent. i.e., the rate of emissions growth is lower than the rate of growth of our GDP. This shows that India has successfully decoupled it s economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the emission intensity of its GDP.Indias total adaptation -relevant expenditure has increased from 3.7 per cent of GDP in 2015 -16 to 5.60 per cent of the GDP in 2021 -2022, indicating integration o f climate resilience and adaptation into development plans. Low Carbon Development and Energy Composition Indias energy needs are expected to grow 2 to 2.5 times by 2047 to meet a growing economys developmental priorities and aspirations. Considering that resources are limited, the survey pointed out that the pace of energy transition would need to factor in alternative demands on the resources for improving resilience to climate change and for sustained social and economic development. Challenges for Energy Transition and Way Forward Highlighting various challenges to Indias development of a low -carbon path , Economic Survey mentioned that e xpanding renewable energy and clean fuels will increase demand for land and water. Most renewables are land -inten sive and demand the highest land use requirements among the different energy sources. Further, the expansion of renewable energy requires battery storage technologies which in turn require the availab ility of critical minerals and the source of such minera ls is geographically concentrated. Recognising the importance of energy efficiency measures in accelerating clean energy transitions while supporting energy security, the Survey highlighted several initiatives taken by the Government to improve energy effi ciency. Some of them include implementing Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) for buildings, Standards and Labelling (SL) and Star- rated program for appliances, Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) initiative for encouraging the adoption of sustainable l ifestyles , Perform , Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme for industri al sector, and Charging Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles for transport sector, among others. All above mentioned initiatives translates to a total annual cost savings of approximately 1,94,320 Crore and an annual CO 2 emissions reduction of around 306 million tonnes. Finance for Sustainable Development The Survey outlines that country has taken many measures to improve the business environment and catalyse greater quantum of resources. The Government undertook the issue of sovereign green bonds amounting to 16,000 Crore in January -February 2023 to raise proceeds for public sector projects that would contribute to the efforts to reduce the intensity of the economys emissions, followed by 20,000 Crore raised through sovereign green bonds in October - December 2023. Further, RBI has implemented the Framework for Acceptance of Green Deposits for the Regulated Entities to foster and develop a green finance ecosystem in the country. In addit ion, the RBI promotes renewable energy through its Priority Sector Lending (PSL) rules.Indias Innovative Green Credit Program The Survey talks about the Government of Indias Mission LiFE , which is envisaged as a mass movement to address climate change and foster sustainable living based on conservation and moderation principles. It further states that to bolster LiFEs effort and encourage eco -friendly practices, the Government also supports vol untary environmental actions such as the Green Credit Programme (GCP), which incentivises individuals, communities, private sector industries, and companies to participate in environment -positive activities by offering green credits as rewards. India leadi ng International Initiatives Addressing Climate Change Issues The survey extensively talks about India leading several international initiatives towards climate change mitigation and building resilience. The International Solar Alliance (ISA), One World, One Sun, One Grid (OSOWOG), the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), the Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) and the Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT) are some of such important examples. NBSNCHPECONOMIC SURVEY 2023 -24 PRESS INFORMATION BUREAU GOVERNMENT OF INDIA INDIA NEEDS TO LOOK AT CLIMATE CHANGE FROM THE LOCAL LENS, INSTEAD OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL PRESCRIPTIONS FROM THE WEST MISSION LiFE FOCUSSES ON HUMAN -NATURE HARMONY PROMOTING MINDFUL CONSUMPTION THAN OVERCONSUMPTION THAT LIES AT THE ROOT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEM New Delhi, 22nd July, 2024 Taking a critical view of the Western approach of tackling Climate Change , the Economic Survey 2023 -24 gives a clarion call to all developing countries to look at climate change problem from a local lens. It states that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work, and developing countries need to be free to choose their own pathways since they are tasked with balancing developmental goals with meaningful climate action. The Economic Survey 2023 -24, tabled by the Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today, clearly states that c urrent global strategies for climate change are flawed and not universally applicable. It states that a dopting the practices of the West could prove to be disastrous for India where culture, economy, societal norms ar e already intertwined with the environment. The document highlights that India, despite making significant strides in climate action, often faces criticism for not aligning with Western solutions. This criti cism stems from a lack of appreciation for Indias unique social and cultural fabric, which is already rich with sustainable development ideas. It further goes on to point out inherent inconsistencies where the prescriptions to tackle Climate Change from t he developed world do not hold ground globally . These are The Western approach does not seek to address the root of the problem, i.e. overconsumption, but rather chooses to substitute the means to achieve overconsumption. The global pursuit of energy -guzzling technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and mining rare earth minerals in large quantities has only contributed to higher fossil fuel consumption. This is directly at odds with the stated objectives of climate change mitigation. Lifest yles in developed countries ignore humans underlying relationship with Nature, with other people, with materiality and with themselves.The Economic Survey 2023 -24 stresses that Indias ethos emphasizes a harmonious relationship with nature, in sharp contrast to the culture of overconsumption prevalent in other parts of the developed world , thus offering sustainable solutions to problems plaguing Western societies. For instance The process of meat production adopted in the developed world pre sents credible food security risks and a threat of permanently degrading the land, water and natural resources critical for human survival. The reliance on human -edible crops to feed livestock has set into motion a food-feed competition as less than half the cereals produced today go towards direct human consumption. These figures are even lower for many developed economies. The Survey notes that t raditional farming practices from the developing world, where several agricultural activities are integrated with livestock rearing, offer one solution to the problem . Repurposing farm waste and by -products from other agricultural activities as animal feed not only lowers the financial and environmental cost of meat production but also brings balance to the natu ral cycle. Shifting livestock to human -inedible feed can free up significant shares of global arable land to address global hunger , it adds . Similarly, the adoption of nucleated families akin to the Western model of living places significant land and reso urce requirements on the environment, as the growth in urban nucleated settlements gives rise to the tendency of urban sprawl . Furthermore, these living spaces are highly inefficient, dominated by concrete, closed spaces, less ventilation and exacting higher energy costs during the summers. A shift towards the traditional multi -generational households would create the pathway towards sustainable housing , notes the Survey . Sourcing materials and labour locally for the construction of houses, central courtyards with well -ventilated spaces, and avenues for natural lighting and cooling would all exert a positive externality on the environment by lowering resource and energy requirements. Such a household would also prove immensely beneficial for the elderly , it states .In order to profess a solution to these issues, t he Economic Survey brings in perspective Prime Minister Shr i Narendra Modis vision of Mission LiFE . It embodies a Lifestyle For Environment seeking to address the wants of the people without letting them hurt Nature . The approach seeks to bring individual responsibility to the forefront of the fight against climate change , as s ustenance is at the core of Indian ethos . The Mission encompasses a comprehensive but non -exhaustive list of 75 LiFE Actions for adoption by individuals to live more sustainably. At its heart, it promotes mindful consumption instead of overconsumption, encourages a circular economy and the reuse of waste products, eating local plant -based cuisines with a low ecological footprint, saving water and energy , notes the Survey . The document quotes the International Energy Agency and states t hat adoption of the kinds of actions and measures targeted by the LiFE initiative worldwide would reduce annual global carbon di -oxide emissions by more than 2 billion tonnes in 2030 (20% of the emissions reductions needed by 2030) and in consumer savings of about USD 440 billion.In conclusion, the Survey document upholds the tenets of Mission LiFE and notes that the global movement on climate change must be accommodative of sovereign choices and economic needs, but centered on individual behavior. Its time to rebuild societies with equanimity , it adds. NBVM\n"

With job creation as a top priority, the survey identifies the need for an average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs every year in non-farm sectors until 2030. However, in light of the increasingly challenging global environment, the survey also emphasizes the need for domestic efforts to drive economic recovery and growth. Additionally, the tripartite compact proposed by the survey aims to further strengthen the economy and make it more resilient to future disruptions.

This is a conservative estimate as India's real GDP grew by 8.2 percent in FY24 and exceeded 8 percent in three out of four quarters. The share of agriculture, industry, and services sectors in the overall GVA at current prices in FY24 were 17.7 percent, 27.6 percent, and 54.7 percent respectively, with the manufacturing sector growing by 9.9 percent. With successful management of administrative and monetary policies, India's retail inflation decreased from 6.7 percent in FY23 to 5.4 percent in FY24. Additionally, the Current Account Deficit (CAD) improved from 2.0 percent of GDP in FY23 to 0.7 percent of GDP in FY24. The Indian economy also recovered and expanded in an orderly fashion post-pandemic, with the real GDP in FY24 being 20 percent higher than its level in FY20.
